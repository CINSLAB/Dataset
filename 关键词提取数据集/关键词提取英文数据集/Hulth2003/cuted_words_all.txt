does classicism explain universality arguments against a pure classical component of mind one of the hallmarks of human cognition is the capacity to generalize over arbitrary constituents marcus cognition 66 p 153 cognitive psychology 37 p 243 1998 argued that this capacity called universal generalization universality is not supported by connectionist models instead universality is best explained by classical symbol systems with connectionism as its implementation here it is argued that universality is also a problem for classicism in that the syntax sensitive rules that are supposed to provide causal explanations of mental processes are either too strict precluding possible generalizations or too lax providing no information as to the appropriate alternative consequently universality is not explained by a classical theory
a conflict between language and atomistic information fred dretske and jerry fodor are responsible for popularizing three well known theses in contemporary philosophy of mind the thesis of information based semantics ibs the thesis of content atomism atomism and the thesis of the language of thought lot lot concerns the semantically relevant structure of representations involved in cognitive states such as beliefs and desires it maintains that all such representations must have syntactic structures mirroring the structure of their contents ibs is a thesis about the nature of the relations that connect cognitive representations and their parts to their contents semantic relations it holds that these relations supervene solely on relations of the kind that support information content perhaps with some help from logical principles of combination atomism is a thesis about the nature of the content of simple symbols it holds that each substantive simple symbol possesses its content independently of all other symbols in the representational system i argue that dretske s and fodor s theories are false and that their falsehood results from a conflict ibs and atomism on the one hand and lot on the other
selective representing and world making we discuss the thesis of selective representing the idea that the contents of the mental representations had by organisms are highly constrained by the biological niches within which the organisms evolved while such a thesis has been defended by several authors elsewhere our primary concern here is to take up the issue of the compatibility of selective representing and realism we hope to show three things first that the notion of selective representing is fully consistent with the realist idea of a mind independent world second that not only are these two consistent but that the latter the realist conception of a mind independent world provides the most powerful perspective from which to motivate and understand the differing perceptual and cognitive profiles themselves third that the genuine and important sense in which organism and environment may together constitute an integrated system of scientific interest poses no additional threat to the realist conception
lob s theorem as a limitation on mechanism we argue that lob s theorem implies a limitation on mechanism specifically we argue via an application of a generalized version of lob s theorem that any particular device known by an observer to be mechanical cannot be used as an epistemic authority of a particular type by that observer either the belief set of such an authority is not mechanizable or if it is there is no identifiable formal system of which the observer can know or truly believe it to be the theorem set this gives we believe an important and hitherto unnoticed connection between mechanism and the use of authorities by human like epistemic agents
games machines play individual rationality or doing what is best for oneself is a standard model used to explain and predict human behavior and von neumann morgenstern game theory is the classical mathematical formalization of this theory in multiple agent settings individual rationality however is an inadequate model for the synthesis of artificial social systems where cooperation is essential since it does not permit the accommodation of group interests other than as aggregations of individual interests satisficing game theory is based upon a well defined notion of being good enough and does accommodate group as well as individual interests through the use of conditional preference relationships whereby a decision maker is able to adjust its preferences as a function of the preferences and not just the options of others this new theory is offered as an alternative paradigm to construct artificial societies that are capable of complex behavior that goes beyond exclusive self interest
the average case identifiability and controllability of large scale systems needs for increased product quality reduced pollution and reduced energy and material consumption are driving enhanced process integration this increases the number of manipulated and measured variables required by the control system to achieve its objectives this paper addresses the question of whether processes tend to become increasingly more difficult to identify and control as the process dimension increases tools and results of multivariable statistics are used to show that under a variety of assumed distributions on the elements square processes of higher dimension tend to be more difficult to identify and control whereas the expected controllability and identifiability of nonsquare processes depends on the relative numbers of measured and manipulated variables these results suggest that the procedure of simplifying the control problem so that only a square process is considered is a poor practice for large scale systems

evolving receptive field controllers for mobile robots the use of evolutionary methods to generate controllers for real world autonomous agents has attracted attention most of the pertinent research has employed genetic algorithms or variations thereof research has applied an alternative evolutionary method evolution strategies to the generation of simple braitenberg vehicles this application accelerates the development of such controllers by more than an order of magnitude a few hours compared to more than two days motivated by this useful speedup the paper investigates the evolution of more complex architectures receptive field controllers that can employ nonlinear interactions and therefore can yield more complex behavior it is interesting to note that the evolution strategy yields the same efficacy in terms of function evaluations even though the second class of controllers requires up to 10 times more parameters than the simple braitenberg architecture in addition to the speedup there is an important theoretical reason for preferring an evolution strategy over a genetic algorithm for this problem namely the presence of epistasis

a scalable model of cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing the recurrent slide and latch rsl model from the dawn of modern neural network theory the mammalian cerebellum has been a favored object of mathematical modeling studies early studies focused on the fanout convergence thresholding and learned weighting of perceptual motor signals within the cerebellar cortex this led to the still viable idea that the granule cell stage in the cerebellar cortex performs a sparse expansive recoding of the time varying input vector this recoding reveals and emphasizes combinations in a distributed representation that serves as a basis for the learned state dependent control actions engendered by cerebellar outputs to movement related centers to make optimal use of available signals the cerebellum must be able to sift the evolving state representation for the most reliable predictors of the need for control actions and to use those predictors even if they appear only transiently and well in advance of the optimal time for initiating the control action the paper proposes a modification to prior population models for cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing since it replaces a population with a single element the proposed rsl model is in one sense maximally efficient and therefore optimal from the perspective of scalability
searching a scalable approach to cerebellar based control decades of research into the structure and function of the cerebellum have led to a clear understanding of many of its cells as well as how learning might take place furthermore there are many theories on what signals the cerebellum operates on and how it works in concert with other parts of the nervous system nevertheless the application of computational cerebellar models to the control of robot dynamics remains in its infant state to date few applications have been realized the currently emerging family of light weight robots poses a new challenge to robot control due to their complex dynamics traditional methods depending on a full analysis of the dynamics of the system are no longer applicable since the joints influence each other dynamics during movement can artificial cerebellar models compete here

secrets of the glasgow haskell compiler inliner higher order languages such as haskell encourage the programmer to build abstractions by composing functions a good compiler must inline many of these calls to recover an efficiently executable program in principle inlining is dead simple just replace the call of a function by an instance of its body but any compiler writer will tell you that inlining is a black art full of delicate compromises that work together to give good performance without unnecessary code bloat the purpose of this paper is therefore to articulate the key lessons we learned from a full scale production inliner the one used in the glasgow haskell compiler we focus mainly on the algorithmic aspects but we also provide some indicative measurements to substantiate the importance of various aspects of the inliner
faking it simulating dependent types in haskell dependent types reflect the fact that validity of data is often a relative notion by allowing prior data to affect the types of subsequent data not only does this make for a precise type system but also a highly generic one both the type and the program for each instance of a family of operations can be computed from the data which codes for that instance recent experimental extensions to the haskell type class mechanism give us strong tools to relativize types to other types we may simulate some aspects of dependent typing by making counterfeit type level copies of data with type constructors simulating data constructors and type classes simulating datatypes this paper gives examples of the technique and discusses its potential
developing a high performance web server in concurrent haskell server applications and in particular network based server applications place a unique combination of demands on a programming language lightweight concurrency high i o throughput and fault tolerance are all important this paper describes a prototype web server written in concurrent haskell with extensions and presents two useful results firstly a conforming server could be written with minimal effort leading to an implementation in less than 1500 lines of code and secondly the naive implementation produced reasonable performance furthermore making minor modifications to a few time critical components improved performance to a level acceptable for anything but the most heavily loaded web servers
a static semantics for haskell this paper gives a static semantics for haskell 98 a non strict purely functional programming language the semantics formally specifies nearly all the details of the haskell 98 type system including the resolution of overloading kind inference including defaulting and polymorphic recursion the only major omission being a proper treatment of ambiguous overloading and its resolution overloading is translated into explicit dictionary passing as in all current implementations of haskell the target language of this translation is a variant of the girard reynolds polymorphic lambda calculus featuring higher order polymorphism and explicit type abstraction and application in the term language translated programs can thus still be type checked although the implicit version of this system is impredicative a surprising result of this formalization effort is that the monomorphism restriction when rendered in a system of inference rules compromises the principal type property
choice preferences without inferences subconscious priming of risk attitudes we present a procedure for subconscious priming of risk attitudes in experiment 1 we were reliably able to induce risk seeking or risk averse preferences across a range of decision scenarios using this priming procedure in experiment 2 we showed that these priming effects can be reversed by drawing participants attention to the priming event our results support claims that the formation of risk preferences can be based on preconscious processing as for example postulated by the affective primacy hypothesis rather than rely on deliberative mental operations as posited by several current models of judgment and decision making
a re examination of probability matching and rational choice in a typical probability learning task participants are presented with a repeated choice between two response alternatives one of which has a higher payoff probability than the other rational choice theory requires that participants should eventually allocate all their responses to the high payoff alternative but previous research has found that people fail to maximize their payoffs instead it is commonly observed that people match their response probabilities to the payoff probabilities we report three experiments on this choice anomaly using a simple probability learning task in which participants were provided with i large financial incentives ii meaningful and regular feedback and iii extensive training in each experiment large proportions of participants adopted the optimal response strategy and all three of the factors mentioned above contributed to this the results are supportive of rational choice theory
eliminating recency with self review the case of auditors going concern judgments this paper examines the use of self review to debias recency recency is found in the going concern judgments of staff auditors but is successfully eliminated by the auditor s use of a simple self review technique that would be extremely easy to implement in audit practice auditors who self review are also less inclined to make audit report choices that are inconsistent with their going concern judgments these results are important because the judgments of staff auditors often determine the type and extent of documentation in audit workpapers and serve as preliminary inputs for senior auditors judgments and choices if staff auditors judgments are affected by recency the impact of this bias may be impounded in the ultimate judgments and choices of senior auditors since biased judgments can expose auditors to significant costs involving extended audit procedures legal liability and diminished reputation simple debiasing techniques that reduce this exposure are valuable the paper also explores some future research needs and other important issues concerning judgment debiasing in applied professional settings
acceptance of a price discount the role of the semantic relatedness between purchases and the comparative price format two studies are reported where people are asked to accept or not a price reduction on a target product in the high low relative saving version the regular price of the target product is low high in both versions the absolute value of the price reduction is the same as well as the total of regular prices of planned purchases as first reported by tversky and kahneman 1981 findings show that the majority of people accept the price discount in the high relative saving version whereas the minority do it in the low one in study 1 findings show that the previous preference reversal disappears when planned purchases are strongly related also a previously unreported preference reversal is found the majority of people accept the price discount when the products are weakly related whereas the minority accept when the products are strongly related in study 2 findings show that the classic preference reversal disappears as a function of the comparative price format also another previously unreported preference reversal is found when the offered price reduction relates to a low priced product people are more inclined to accept it with a control than a minimal comparative price format findings reported in studies 1 and 2 are interpreted in terms of mental accounting shifts
bigger is better the influence of physical size on aesthetic preference judgments the hypothesis that the physical size of an object can influence aesthetic preferences was investigated in a series of four experiments participants were presented with pairs of abstract stimuli and asked to indicate which member of each pair they preferred a preference for larger stimuli was found on the majority of trials using various types of stimuli stimuli of various sizes and with both adult and 3 year old participants this preference pattern was disrupted only when participants had both stimuli that provided a readily accessible alternative source of preference evoking information and sufficient attentional resources to make their preference judgments
mustering motivation to enact decisions how decision process characteristics influence goal realization decision scientists tend to focus mainly on decision antecedents studying how people make decisions action psychologists in contrast study post decision issues investigating how decisions once formed are maintained protected and enacted through the research presented here we seek to bridge these two disciplines proposing that the process by which decisions are reached motivates subsequent pursuit and benefits eventual realization we identify three characteristics of the decision process dp as having motivation mustering potential dp effort investment dp importance and dp confidence through two field studies tracking participants decision processes pursuit and realization we find that after controlling for the influence of the motivational mechanisms of goal intention and implementation intention the three decision process characteristics significantly influence the successful enactment of the chosen decision directly the theoretical and practical implications of these findings are considered and future research opportunities are identified

fidelity of quantum teleportation through noisy channels we investigate quantum teleportation through noisy quantum channels by solving analytically and numerically a master equation in the lindblad form we calculate the fidelity as a function of decoherence rates and angles of a state to be teleported it is found that the average fidelity and the range of states to be accurately teleported depend on types of noises acting on quantum channels if the quantum channels are subject to isotropic noise the average fidelity decays to 1 2 which is smaller than the best possible value of 2 3 obtained only by the classical communication on the other hand if the noisy quantum channel is modeled by a single lindblad operator the average fidelity is always greater than 2 3
operations that do not disturb partially known quantum states consider a situation in which a quantum system is secretly prepared in a state chosen from the known set of states we present a principle that gives a definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the system and those that disturb the states the principle is derived by alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a fundamental property of quantum ones the principle can be cast into a simple form by using a decomposition of the relevant hilbert space which is uniquely determined by the set of possible states the decomposition implies the classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state one storing it classically one storing it nonclassically and the other one storing no information then the principle states that the nonclassical part is inaccessible and the classical part is read only if we are to preserve the state of the system from this principle many types of no cloning no broadcasting and no imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general forms including mixed states it also gives a unified view on how various schemes of quantum cryptography work the principle helps one to derive optimum amount of resources bits qubits and ebits required in data compression or in quantum teleportation of mixed state ensembles

does social capital determine innovation to what extent this paper deals with two questions does social capital determine innovation in manufacturing firms if it is the case to what extent to deal with these questions we review the literature on innovation in order to see how social capital came to be added to the other forms of capital as an explanatory variable of innovation in doing so we have been led to follow the dominating view of the literature on social capital and innovation which claims that social capital cannot be captured through a single indicator but that it actually takes many different forms that must be accounted for therefore to the traditional explanatory variables of innovation we have added five forms of structural social capital business network assets information network assets research network assets participation assets and relational assets and one form of cognitive social capital reciprocal trust in a context where empirical investigations regarding the relations between social capital and innovation are still scanty this paper makes contributions to the advancement of knowledge in providing new evidence regarding the impact and the extent of social capital on innovation at the two decisionmaking stages considered in this study

computer aided classification of masses in ultrasonic mammography frequency compounding was recently investigated for computer aided classification of masses in ultrasonic b mode images as benign or malignant the classification was performed using the normalized parameters of the nakagami distribution at a single region of interest at the site of the mass a combination of normalized nakagami parameters from two different images of a mass was undertaken to improve the performance of classification receiver operating characteristic roc analysis showed that such an approach resulted in an area of 0 83 under the roc curve the aim of the work described in this paper is to see whether a feature describing the characteristic of the boundary can be extracted and combined with the nakagami parameter to further improve the performance of classification the combination of the features has been performed using a weighted summation results indicate a 10 improvement in specificity at a sensitivity of 96 after combining the information at the site and at the boundary moreover the technique requires minimal clinical intervention and has a performance that reaches that of the trained radiologist it is hence suggested that this technique may be utilized in practice to characterize breast masses

fast and accurate leaf verification for dynamic multileaf collimation using an electronic portal imaging device a prerequisite for accurate dose delivery of imrt profiles produced with dynamic multileaf collimation dmlc is highly accurate leaf positioning in our institution leaf verification for dmlc was initially done with film and ionization chamber to overcome the limitations of these methods a fast accurate and two dimensional method for daily leaf verification using our ccd camera based electronic portal imaging device epid has been developed this method is based on a flat field produced with a 0 5 cm wide sliding gap for each leaf pair deviations in gap widths are detected as deviations in gray scale value profiles derived from the epid images and not by directly assessing leaf positions in the images dedicated software was developed to reduce the noise level in the low signal images produced with the narrow gaps the accuracy of this quality assurance procedure was tested by introducing known leaf position errors it was shown that errors in leaf gap as small as 0 01 0 02 cm could be detected which is certainly adequate to guarantee accurate dose delivery of dmlc treatments even for strongly modulated beam profiles using this method it was demonstrated that both short and long term reproducibility in leaf positioning were within 0 01 cm 1 sigma for all gantry angles and that the effect of gravity was negligible
a three source model for the calculation of head scatter factors accurate determination of the head scatter factor s sub c is an important issue especially for intensity modulated radiation therapy where the segmented fields are often very irregular and much less than the collimator jaw settings in this work we report an s sub c calculation algorithm for symmetric asymmetric and irregular open fields shaped by the tertiary collimator a multileaf collimator or blocks at different source to chamber distance the algorithm was based on a three source model in which the photon radiation to the point of calculation was treated as if it originated from three effective sources one source for the primary photons from the target and two extra focal photon sources for the scattered photons from the primary collimator and the flattening filter respectively the field mapping method proposed by kim et al phys med biol 43 1593 1604 1998 was extended to two extra focal source planes and the scatter contributions were integrated over the projected areas determined by the detector s eye view in the three source planes considering the source intensity distributions the algorithm was implemented using microsoft visual c c in the ms windows environment the only input data required were head scatter factors for symmetric square fields which are normally acquired during machine commissioning a large number of different fields were used to evaluate the algorithm and the results were compared with measurements we found that most of the calculated s sub c s agreed with the measured values to within 0 4 the algorithm can also be easily applied to deal with irregular fields shaped by a multileaf collimator that replaces the upper or lower collimator jaws
simultaneous iterative reconstruction of emission and attenuation images in positron emission tomography from emission data only for quantitative image reconstruction in positron emission tomography attenuation correction is mandatory in case that no data are available for the calculation of the attenuation correction factors one can try to determine them from the emission data alone however it is not clear if the information content is sufficient to yield an adequate attenuation correction together with a satisfactory activity distribution therefore we determined the log likelihood distribution for a thorax phantom depending on the choice of attenuation and activity pixel values to measure the crosstalk between both in addition an iterative image reconstruction one dimensional newton type algorithm with a maximum likelihood estimator which simultaneously reconstructs the images of the activity distribution and the attenuation coefficients is used to demonstrate the problems and possibilities of such a reconstruction as result we show that for a change of the log likelihood in the range of statistical noise the associated change in the activity value of a structure is between 6 and 263 in addition we show that it is not possible to choose the best maximum on the basis of the log likelihood when a regularization is used because the coupling between different structures mediated by the smoothing regularization prevents an adequate solution due to crosstalk we conclude that taking into account the attenuation information in the emission data improves the performance of image reconstruction with respect to the bias of the activities however the reconstruction still is not quantitative
mammogram synthesis using a 3d simulation ii evaluation of synthetic mammogram texture we have evaluated a method for synthesizing mammograms by comparing the texture of clinical and synthetic mammograms the synthesis algorithm is based upon simulations of breast tissue and the mammographic imaging process mammogram texture was synthesized by projections of simulated adipose tissue compartments it was hypothesized that the synthetic and clinical texture have similar properties assuming that the mammogram texture reflects the 3d tissue distribution the size of the projected compartments was computed by mathematical morphology the texture energy and fractal dimension were also computed and analyzed in terms of the distribution of texture features within four different tissue regions in clinical and synthetic mammograms comparison of the cumulative distributions of the mean features computed from 95 mammograms showed that the synthetic images simulate the mean features of the texture of clinical mammograms correlation of clinical and synthetic texture feature histograms averaged over all images showed that the synthetic images can simulate the range of features seen over a large group of mammograms the best agreement with clinical texture was achieved for simulated compartments with radii of 4 13 3 mm in predominantly adipose tissue regions and radii of 2 7 5 33 and 1 3 2 7 mm in retroareolar and dense fibroglandular tissue regions respectively

angular disparity in etact scintimammography emission tuned aperture computed tomography etact has been previously shown to have the potential for the detection of small tumors 1 cm in scintimammography however the optimal approach to the application of etact in the clinic has yet to be determined therefore we sought to determine the effect of the angular disparity between the etact projections on image quality through the use of a computer simulation a small spherical tumor of variable size 5 7 5 or 10 mm was placed at the center of a hemispherical breast 15 cm diameter the tumor to nontumor ratio was either 5 1 or 10 1 the detector was modeled to be a gamma camera fitted with a 4 mm diam pinhole collimator the pinhole to detector and the pinhole to tumor distances were 25 and 15 cm respectively a ray tracing technique was used to generate three sets of projections 10 degrees 15 degrees and 20 degrees angular disparity these data were blurred to a resolution consistent with the 4 mm pinhole the tact reconstruction method was used to reconstruct these three image sets the tumor contrast and the axial spatial resolution was measured smaller angular disparity led to an improvement in image contrast but at a cost of degraded axial spatial resolution the improvement in contrast is due to a slight improvement in the in plane spatial resolution since improved contrast should lead to better tumor detectability smaller angular disparity should be used however the difference in contrast between 10 degrees and 15 degrees was very slight and therefore a reasonable clinical choice for angular disparity is 15 degrees

effect of multileaf collimator leaf width on physical dose distributions in the treatment of cns and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy the purpose of this work is to examine physical radiation dose differences between two multileaf collimator mlc leaf widths 5 and 10 mm in the treatment of cns and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt three clinical patients with cns tumors were planned with two different mlc leaf sizes 5 and 10 mm representing varian 120 and varian 80 millennium multileaf collimators respectively two sets of imrt treatment plans were developed the goal of the first set was radiation dose conformality in three dimensions the goal for the second set was organ avoidance of a nearby critical structure while maintaining adequate coverage of the target volume treatment planning utilized the cadplan helios system varian medical systems milpitas ca for dynamic mlc treatment delivery all beam parameters and optimization cost function parameters were identical for the 5 and 10 mm plans for all cases the number of beams gantry positions and table positions were taken from clinically treated three dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans conformality was measured by the ratio of the planning isodose volume to the target volume organ avoidance was measured by the volume of the critical structure receiving greater than 90 of the prescription dose v sub 90 for three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck t2 t4 n0 n2c m0 5 and 10 mm leaf widths were compared for parotid preservation utilizing nine coplanar equally spaced beams delivering a simultaneous integrated boost because modest differences in physical dose to the parotid were detected a ntcp model based upon the clinical parameters of eisbruch et al was then used for comparisons the conformality improved in all three cns cases for the 5 mm plans compared to the 10 mm plans for the organ avoidance plans v sub 90 also improved in two of the three cases when the 5 mm leaf width was utilized for imrt treatment delivery in the third case both the 5 and 10 mm plans were able to spare the critical structure with none of the structure receiving more than 90 of the prescription dose but in the moderate dose range less dose was delivered to the critical structure with the 5 mm plan for the head and neck cases both the 5 and 10 2 5 mm beamlets dmlc sliding window techniques spared the contralateral parotid gland while maintaining target volume coverage the mean parotid dose was modestly lower with the smaller beamlet size 21 04 gy vs 22 36 gy the resulting average ntcp values were 13 72 for 10 mm dmlc and 8 24 for 5 mm dmlc in conclusion five mm leaf width results in an improvement in physical dose distribution over 10 mm leaf width that may be clinically relevant in some cases these differences may be most pronounced for single fraction radiosurgery or in cases where the tolerance of the sensitive organ is less than or close to the target volume prescription
a method for geometrical verification of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy using a scanning electronic portal imaging device in order to guarantee the safe delivery of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy imrt verification of the leaf trajectories during the treatment is necessary our aim in this study is to develop a method for on line verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic portal imaging device with scanning read out independent of the multileaf collimator examples of such scanning imagers are electronic portal imaging devices epids based on liquid filled ionization chambers and those based on amorphous silicon portal images were acquired continuously with a liquid filled ionization chamber epid during the delivery together with the signal of treatment progress that is generated by the accelerator for each portal image the prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic prescription and the progress information motion distortion effects of the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is recorded for each image row the aperture formed by the prescribed leaves and diaphragms is used as the reference field edge while the actual field edge is found using a maximum gradient edge detector the errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations between the reference field edge and the detected field edge earlier measurements of the dynamic epid response show that the accuracy of the detected field edge is better than 1 mm to ensure that the verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress signal the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand the method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions using the described method we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges verifying a single portal image took 0 1 s on an 866 mhz personal computer two flaws in the control system of our experimental dynamic multileaf collimator were correctly revealed with our method first the errors in leaf position increase with leaf speed indicating a delay of approximately 0 8 s in the control system second the accuracy of the leaves and diaphragms depends on the direction of motion in conclusion the described verification method is suitable for detailed verification of leaf trajectories during dynamic imrt
incorporating multi leaf collimator leaf sequencing into iterative imrt optimization intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt treatment planning typically considers beam optimization and beam delivery as separate tasks following optimization a multi leaf collimator mlc or other beam delivery device is used to generate fluence patterns for patient treatment delivery due to limitations and characteristics of the mlc the deliverable intensity distributions often differ from those produced by the optimizer leading to differences between the delivered and the optimized doses objective function parameters are then adjusted empirically and the plan is reoptimized to achieve a desired deliverable dose distribution the resulting plan though usually acceptable may not be the best achievable a method has been developed to incorporate the mlc restrictions into the optimization process our in house imrt system has been modified to include the calculation of the deliverable intensity into the optimizer in this process prior to dose calculation the mlc leaf sequencer is used to convert intensities to dynamic mlc sequences from which the deliverable intensities are then determined all other optimization steps remain the same to evaluate the effectiveness of deliverable based optimization 17 patient cases have been studied compared with standard optimization plus conversion to deliverable beams deliverable based optimization results show improved isodose coverage and a reduced dose to critical structures deliverable based optimization results are close to the original nondeliverable optimization results suggesting that imrt can overcome the mlc limitations by adjusting individual beamlets the use of deliverable based optimization may reduce the need for empirical adjustment of objective function parameters and reoptimization of a plan to achieve desired results
direct aperture optimization a turnkey solution for step and shoot imrt imrt treatment plans for step and shoot delivery have traditionally been produced through the optimization of intensity distributions or maps for each beam angle the optimization step is followed by the application of a leaf sequencing algorithm that translates each intensity map into a set of deliverable aperture shapes in this article we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass the traditional intensity optimization and instead directly optimize the shapes and the weights of the apertures we call this approach direct aperture optimization this technique allows the user to specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction and hence provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment delivery this is possible because the machine dependent delivery constraints imposed by the mlc are enforced within the aperture optimization algorithm rather than in a separate leaf sequencing step the leaf settings and the aperture intensities are optimized simultaneously using a simulated annealing algorithm we have tested direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the egs4 beam monte carlo package for our dose calculation engine the results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce highly conformal step and shoot treatment plans using only three to five apertures per beam direction as compared with traditional optimization strategies our studies demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number of beam segments and the number of monitor units direct aperture optimization therefore produces highly efficient treatment deliveries that maintain the full dosimetric benefits of imrt
the effect of voxel size on the accuracy of dose volume histograms of prostate sup 125 i seed implants cumulative dose volume histograms dvh are crucial in evaluating the quality of radioactive seed prostate implants when calculating dvhs the choice of voxel size is a compromise between computational speed larger voxels and accuracy smaller voxels we quantified the effect of voxel size on the accuracy of dvhs using an in house computer program the program was validated by comparison with a hand calculated dvh for a single 0 4 u iodine 125 model 6711 seed we used the program to find the voxel size required to obtain accurate dvhs of five iodine 125 prostate implant patients at our institution one millimeter cubes were sufficient to obtain dvhs that are accurate within 5 up to 200 of the prescription dose for the five patient plans we obtained good agreement with the variseed version 6 7 varian usa treatment planning software s dvh algorithm by using voxels with a sup inf dimension equal to the spacing between successive transverse seed implant planes 5 mm the volume that receives at least 200 of the target dose v sub 200 calculated by variseed was 30 to 43 larger than that calculated by our program with small voxels the single seed dvh calculated by variseed fell below the hand calculation by up to 50 at low doses 30 gy and above it by over 50 at high doses 250 gy
a leaf sequencing algorithm to enlarge treatment field length in imrt with mlc based imrt the maximum usable field size is often smaller than the maximum field size for conventional treatments this is due to the constraints of the overtravel distances of mlc leaves and or jaws using a new leaf sequencing algorithm the usable imrt field length perpendicular to the mlc motion can be mostly made equal to the full length of the mlc field without violating the upper jaw overtravel limit for any given intensity pattern a criterion was proposed to assess whether an intensity pattern can be delivered without violation of the jaw position constraints if the criterion is met the new algorithm will consider the jaw position constraints during the segmentation for the step and shoot delivery method the strategy employed by the algorithm is to connect the intensity elements outside the jaw overtravel limits with those inside the jaw overtravel limits several methods were used to establish these connections during segmentation by modifying a previously published algorithm areal algorithm including changing the intensity level alternating the leaf sequencing direction or limiting the segment field size the algorithm was tested with 1000 random intensity patterns with dimensions of 21 27 cm sup 2 800 intensity patterns with higher intensity outside the jaw overtravel limit and three different types of clinical treatment plans that were undeliverable using a segmentation method from a commercial treatment planning system the new algorithm achieved a success rate of 100 with these test patterns for the 1000 random patterns the new algorithm yields a similar average number of segments of 36 9 or 2 9 in comparison to 36 6 or 1 3 when using the areal algorithm for the 800 patterns with higher intensities outside the jaw overtravel limits the new algorithm results in an increase of 25 in the average number of segments compared to the areal algorithm however the areal algorithm fails to create deliverable segments for 90 of these patterns using a single isocenter the new algorithm provides a solution to extend the usable imrt field length from 21 to 27 cm for imrt on a commercial linear accelerator using the step and shoot delivery method
favorable noise uniformity properties of fourier based interpolation and reconstruction approaches in single slice helical computed tomography volumes reconstructed by standard methods from single slice helical computed tomography ct data have been shown to have noise levels that are highly nonuniform relative to those in conventional ct these noise nonuniformities can affect low contrast object detectability and have also been identified as the cause of the zebra artifacts that plague maximum intensity projection mip images of such volumes while these spatially variant noise levels have their root in the peculiarities of the helical scan geometry there is also a strong dependence on the interpolation and reconstruction algorithms employed in this paper we seek to develop image reconstruction strategies that eliminate or reduce at its source the nonuniformity of noise levels in helical ct relative to that in conventional ct we pursue two approaches independently and in concert we argue and verify that fourier based longitudinal interpolation approaches lead to more uniform noise ratios than do the standard 360li and 180li approaches we also demonstrate that a fourier based fan to parallel rebinning algorithm used as an alternative to fanbeam filtered backprojection for slice reconstruction also leads to more uniform noise ratios even when making use of the 180li and 360li interpolation approaches

sensorless control of induction motor drives controlled induction motor drives without mechanical speed sensors at the motor shaft have the attractions of low cost and high reliability to replace the sensor the information on the rotor speed is extracted from measured stator voltages and currents at the motor terminals vector controlled drives require estimating the magnitude and spatial orientation of the fundamental magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor open loop estimators or closed loop observers are used for this purpose they differ with respect to accuracy robustness and sensitivity against model parameter variations dynamic performance and steady state speed accuracy in the low speed range can be achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine the overview in this paper uses signal flow graphs of complex space vector quantities to provide an insightful description of the systems used in sensorless control of induction motors

buying into the relationship business software choosing the right software to improve business processes can have a huge impact on a company s efficiency and profitability while it is sometimes hard to get beyond vendor hype about software features and functionality and know what to realistically expect it is even more difficult to determine if the vendor is the right vendor to partner with thus picking the right software is important but companies have to realize that what they are really buying into is a relationship with the vendor
on the monotonicity conservation in numerical solutions of the heat equation it is important to choose such numerical methods in practice that mirror the characteristic properties of the described process beyond the stability and convergence the investigated qualitative property in this paper is the conservation of the monotonicity in space of the initial heat distribution we prove some statements about the monotonicity conservation and total monotonicity of one step vector iterations then applying these results we consider the numerical solutions of the one dimensional heat equation our main theorem formulates the necessary and sufficient condition of the uniform monotonicity conservation the sharpness of the conditions is demonstrated by numerical examples

operator splitting and approximate factorization for taxis diffusion reaction models in this paper we consider the numerical solution of 2d systems of certain types of taxis diffusion reaction equations from mathematical biology by spatial discretization these pde systems are approximated by systems of positive nonlinear odes method of lines the aim of this paper is to examine the numerical integration of these ode systems for low to moderate accuracy by means of splitting techniques an important consideration is maintenance of positivity we apply operator splitting and approximate matrix factorization using low order explicit runge kutta methods and linearly implicit runge kutta rosenbrock methods as a reference method the general purpose solver vodpk is applied
new methods for oscillatory problems based on classical codes the numerical integration of differential equations with oscillatory solutions is a very common problem in many fields of the applied sciences some methods have been specially devised for this kind of problem in most of them the calculation of the coefficients needs more computational effort than the classical codes because such coefficients depend on the step size in a not simple manner on the contrary in this work we present new algorithms specially designed for perturbed oscillators whose coefficients have a simple dependence on the step size the methods obtained are competitive when comparing with classical and special codes

multiple shooting using a dichotomically stable integrator for solving differential algebraic equations in previous work by the first author it has been established that a dichotomically stable discretization is needed when solving a stiff boundary value problem in ordinary differential equations odes when sharp boundary layers may occur at each end of the interval a dichotomically stable implicit runge kutta method using the 3 stage fourth order lobatto iiia formulae has been implemented in a variable step size initial value integrator which could be used in a multiple shooting approach in the case of index one differential algebraic equations daes the use of the lobatto iiia formulae has an advantage over a comparable gaussian method that the order is the same for both differential and algebraic variables and there is no need to treat them separately the ode integrator has been adapted for the solution of index one daes and the resulting integrator symdae has been inserted into the multiple shooting code mshdae previously developed by r lamour for differential algebraic boundary value problems the standard version of mshdae uses a bdf integrator which is not dichotomically stable and for some stiff test problems this fails to integrate across the interval of interest while the dichotomically stable integrator symdae encounters no difficulty indeed for such problems the modified version of mshdae produces an accurate solution and within limits imposed by computer word length the efficiency of the solution process improves with increasing stiffness for some nonstiff problems the solution is also entirely satisfactory
numerical behaviour of stable and unstable solitary waves in this paper we analyse the behaviour in time of the numerical approximations to solitary wave solutions of the generalized benjamin bona mahony equation this equation possesses an important property the stability of these solutions depends on their velocity we identify the error propagation mechanisms in both the stable and unstable case in particular we show that in the stable case numerical methods that preserve some conserved quantities of the problem are more appropriate for the simulation of this kind of solutions
post projected runge kutta methods for index 2 differential algebraic equations a new projection technique for runge kutta methods applied to index 2 differential algebraic equations is presented in which the numerical approximation is projected only as part of the output process it is shown that for methods that are strictly stable at infinity the order of convergence is unaffected compared to standard projected methods gauss methods for which this technique is of special interest when some symmetry is to be preserved are studied in more detail
quasi stage order conditions for sdirk methods the stage order condition is a simplifying assumption that reduces the number of order conditions to be fulfilled when designing a runge kutta rk method because a dirk diagonally implicit rk method cannot have stage order greater than 1 we introduce quasi stage order conditions and derive some of their properties for dirks we use these conditions to derive a low order dirk method with embedded error estimator numerical tests with stiff odes and daes of index 1 and 2 indicate that the method is competitive with other rk methods for low accuracy tolerances
national learning systems a new approach on technological change in late industrializing economies and evidences from the cases of brazil and south korea the paper has two intertwined parts the first one is a proposal for a conceptual and theoretical framework to understand technical change in late industrializing economies the second part develops a kind of empirical test of the usefulness of that new framework by means of a comparative study of the brazilian and south korean cases all the four types of macroevidences of the technical change processes of brazil and korea corroborate directly or indirectly the hypothesis of the existence of actual cases of national learning systems nlss of passive and active nature as it is shown to be the cases of brazil and south korea respectively the contrast between the two processes of technical change prove remarkable despite both processes being essentially confined to learning the concepts of passive and active nlss show how useful they are to apprehend the diversity of those realities and consequently to avoid for instance interpretations that misleadingly suppose based on conventional economic theory that those countries have a similar lack of technological dynamism
self organized critical traffic in parallel computer networks in a recent paper we analysed the dynamics of traffic flow in a simple square lattice architecture it was shown that a phase transition takes place between a free and a congested phase the transition point was shown to exhibit optimal information transfer and wide fluctuations in time with scale free properties in this paper we further extend our analysis by considering a generalization of the previous model in which the rate of packet emission is regulated by the local congestion perceived by each node as a result of the feedback between traffic congestion and packet release the system is poised at criticality many well known statistical features displayed by internet traffic are recovered from our model in a natural way
from continuous recovery to discrete filtering in numerical approximations of conservation laws modern numerical approximations of conservation laws rely on numerical dissipation as a means of stabilization the older alternative approach is the use of central differencing with a dose of artificial dissipation in this paper we review the successful class of weighted essentially non oscillatory finite volume schemes which comprise sophisticated methods of the first kind new developments in image processing have made new devices possible which can serve as highly nonlinear artificial dissipation terms we view artificial dissipation as discrete filter operation and introduce several new algorithms inspired by image processing

hpcview a tool for top down analysis of node performance it is increasingly difficult for complex scientific programs to attain a significant fraction of peak performance on systems that are based on microprocessors with substantial instruction level parallelism and deep memory hierarchies despite this trend performance analysis and tuning tools are still not used regularly by algorithm and application designers to a large extent existing performance tools fail to meet many user needs and are cumbersome to use to address these issues we developed hpcview a toolkit for combining multiple sets of program profile data correlating the data with source code and generating a database that can be analyzed anywhere with a commodity web browser we argue that hpcview addresses many of the issues that have limited the usability and the utility of most existing tools we originally built hpcview to facilitate our own work on data layout and optimizing compilers now in addition to daily use within our group hpcview is being used by several code development teams in dod and doe laboratories as well as at ncsa

packet spacing an enabling mechanism for delivering multimedia content in computational grids streaming multimedia with udp has become increasingly popular over distributed systems like the internet scientific applications that stream multimedia include remote computational steering of visualization data and video on demand teleconferencing over the access grid however udp does not possess a self regulating congestion control mechanism and most best effort traffic is served by congestion controlled tcp consequently udp steals bandwidth from tcp such that tcp flows starve for network resources with the volume of internet traffic continuing to increase the perpetuation of udp based streaming will cause the internet to collapse as it did in the mid 1980 s due to the use of non congestion controlled tcp to address this problem we introduce the counter intuitive notion of inter packet spacing with control feedback to enable udp based applications to perform well in the next generation internet and computational grids when compared with traditional udp based streaming we illustrate that our approach can reduce packet loss over 50 without adversely affecting delivered throughput

high level language support for user defined reductions the optimized handling of reductions on parallel supercomputers or clusters of workstations is critical to high performance because reductions are common in scientific codes and a potential source of bottlenecks yet in many high level languages a mechanism for writing efficient reductions remains surprisingly absent further when such mechanisms do exist they often do not provide the flexibility a programmer needs to achieve a desirable level of performance in this paper we present a new language construct for arbitrary reductions that lets a programmer achieve a level of performance equal to that achievable with the highly flexible but low level combination of fortran and mpi we have implemented this construct in the zpl language and evaluate it in the context of the initialization of the nas mg benchmark we show a 45 times speedup over the same code written in zpl without this construct in addition performance on a large number of processors surpasses that achieved in the nas implementation showing that our mechanism provides programmers with the needed flexibility
formula dependent equivalence for compositional ctl model checking we present a polytime computable state equivalence that is defined with respect to a given ctl formula since it does not attempt to preserve all ctl formulas like bisimulation does we can expect to compute coarser equivalences this equivalence can be used to reduce the complexity of model checking a system of interacting fsm additionally we show that in some cases our techniques can detect if a formula passes or fails without forming the entire product machine the method is exact and fully automatic and handles full ctl
adaptive optimizing compilers for the 21st century historically compilers have operated by applying a fixed set of optimizations in a predetermined order we call such an ordered list of optimizations a compilation sequence this paper describes a prototype system that uses biased random search to discover a program specific compilation sequence that minimizes an explicit external objective function the result is a compiler framework that adapts its behavior to the application being compiled to the pool of available transformations to the objective function and to the target machine this paper describes experiments that attempt to characterize the space that the adaptive compiler must search the preliminary results suggest that optimal solutions are rare and that local minima are frequent if this holds true biased random searches such as a genetic algorithm should find good solutions more quickly than simpler strategies such as hill climbing

formalization of weighted factors analysis weighted factors analysis wefa has been proposed as a new approach for elicitation representation and manipulation of knowledge about a given problem generally at a high and strategic level central to this proposal is that a group of experts in the area of the problem can identify a hierarchy of factors with positive or negative influences on the problem outcome the tangible output of wefa is a directed weighted graph called a wefa graph this is a set of nodes denoting factors that can directly or indirectly influence an overall aim of the graph the aim is also represented by a node each directed arc is a direct influence of one factor on another a chain of directed arcs indicates an indirect influence the influences may be identified as either positive or negative for example sales and costs are two factors that influence the aim of profitability in an organization sales has a positive influence on profitability and costs has a negative influence on profitability in addition the relative significance of each influence is represented by a weight we develop binary wefa which is a variant of wefa where the factors in the graph are restricted to being either true or false imposing this restriction on a wefa graph allows us to be more precise about the meaning of the graph and of reasoning in it binary wefa is a new proposal that provides a formal yet sufficiently simple language for logic based argumentation for use by business people in decision support and knowledge management whilst binary wefa is expressively simpler than other logic based argumentation formalisms it does incorporate a novel formalization of the notion of significance

efficient parallel programming on scalable shared memory systems with high performance fortran openmp offers a high level interface for parallel programming on scalable shared memory smp architectures it provides the user with simple work sharing directives while it relies on the compiler to generate parallel programs based on thread parallelism however the lack of language features for exploiting data locality often results in poor performance since the non uniform memory access times on scalable smp machines cannot be neglected high performance fortran hpf the de facto standard for data parallel programming offers a rich set of data distribution directives in order to exploit data locality but it has been mainly targeted towards distributed memory machines in this paper we describe an optimized execution model for hpf programs on smp machines that avails itself with mechanisms provided by openmp for work sharing and thread parallelism while exploiting data locality based on user specified distribution directives data locality does not only ensure that most memory accesses are close to the executing threads and are therefore faster but it also minimizes synchronization overheads especially in the case of unstructured reductions the proposed shared memory execution model for hpf relies on a small set of language extensions which resemble the openmp work sharing features these extensions together with an optimized shared memory parallelization and execution model have been implemented in the adaptor hpf compilation system and experimental results verify the efficiency of the chosen approach

advanced optimization strategies in the rice dhpf compiler high performance fortran hpf was envisioned as a vehicle for modernizing legacy fortran codes to achieve scalable parallel performance to a large extent today s commercially available hpf compilers have failed to deliver scalable parallel performance for a broad spectrum of applications because of insufficiently powerful compiler analysis and optimization substantial restructuring and hand optimization can be required to achieve acceptable performance with an hpf port of an existing fortran application even for regular data parallel applications a key goal of the rice dhpf compiler project has been to develop optimization techniques that enable a wide range of existing scientific applications to be ported easily to efficient hpf with minimal restructuring this paper describes the challenges to effective parallelization presented by complex but regular data parallel applications and then describes how the novel analysis and optimization technologies in the dhpf compiler address these challenges effectively without major rewriting of the applications we illustrate the techniques by describing their use for parallelizing the nas sp and bt benchmarks the dhpf compiler generates multipartitioned parallelizations of these codes that are approaching the scalability and efficiency of sophisticated hand coded parallelizations
achieving performance under openmp on ccnuma and software distributed shared memory systems openmp is emerging as a viable high level programming model for shared memory parallel systems it was conceived to enable easy portable application development on this range of systems and it has also been implemented on cache coherent non uniform memory access ccnuma architectures unfortunately it is hard to obtain high performance on the latter architecture particularly when large numbers of threads are involved in this paper we discuss the difficulties faced when writing openmp programs for ccnuma systems and explain how the vendors have attempted to overcome them we focus on one such system the sgi origin 2000 and perform a variety of experiments designed to illustrate the impact of the vendor s efforts we compare codes written in a standard loop level parallel style under openmp with alternative versions written in a single program multiple data spmd fashion also realized via openmp and show that the latter consistently provides superior performance a carefully chosen set of language extensions can help us translate programs from the former style to the latter or to compile directly but in a similar manner syntax for these extensions can be borrowed from hpf and some aspects of hpf compiler technology can help the translation process it is our expectation that an extended language if well compiled would improve the attractiveness of openmp as a language for high performance computation on an important class of modern architectures
finding performance bugs with the tno hpf benchmark suite high performance fortran hpf has been designed to provide portable performance on distributed memory machines an important aspect of portable performance is the behavior of the available hpf compilers ideally a programmer may expect comparable performance between different hpf compilers given the same program and the same machine to test the performance portability between compilers we have designed a special benchmark suite called the tno hpf benchmark suite it consists of a set of hpf programs that test various aspects of efficient parallel code generation the benchmark suite consists of a number of template programs that are used to generate test programs with different array sizes alignments distributions and iteration spaces it ranges from very simple assignments to more complex assignments such as triangular iteration spaces convex iteration spaces coupled subscripts and indirection arrays we have run the tno hpf benchmark suite on three compilers the prepare prototype compiler the pgi hpf compiler and the gmd adaptor hpf compiler results show performance differences that can be quite large up to two orders of magnitude for the same test program closer inspection reveals that the origin of most of the differences in performance is due to differences in local enumeration and storage of distributed array elements
compatibility comparison and performance evaluation for japanese hpf compilers using scientific applications the lack of compatibility of high performance fortran hpf between vender implementations has been disheartening scientific application users so as to hinder the development of portable programs thus parallel computing is still unpopular in the computational science community even though parallel programming is common to the computer science community as users would like to run the same source code on parallel machines with different architectures as fast as possible we have investigated the compatibility of source codes for japanese hpf compilers nec fujitsu and hitachi with two real world applications a 3d fluid code and a 2d particle code we have found that the source level compatibility between japanese hpf compilers is almost preserved but more effort will be needed to sustain complete compatibility we have also evaluated parallel performance and found that hpf can achieve good performance for the 3d fluid code with almost the same source code for the 2d particle code good results have also been obtained with a small number of processors but some changes in the original source code and the addition of interface blocks is required

succession in standardization grafting xml onto sgml succession in standardization is often a problem the advantages of improvements must be weighed against those of compatibility if compatibility considerations dominate a grafting process takes place according to our taxonomy of succession there are three types of outcomes a type i succession where grafting is successful entails compatibility between successors technical paradigm compliance and continuity in the standards trajectory in this paper we examine issues of succession and focus on the extensible markup language xml it was to be grafted on the standard generalized markup language sgml a stable standard since 1988 however xml was a profile a subset and an extension of sgml 1988 adaptation of sgml was needed sgml 1999 to forge full downward compatibility with xml 1998 we describe the grafting efforts and analyze their outcomes our conclusion is that although sgml was a technical exemplar for xml developers full compatibility was not achieved the widespread use of hypertext mark up language html exemplified the desirability of simplicity in xml standardization this and html s user market largely explain the discontinuity in sgml xml succession

definition of a similarity measure between cases based on auto cross fuzzy thesauri a similarity measure between cases is needed in order to evaluate the degree of similarity when using past similar cases in order to resolve current problems in similar case retrieval multiple indices are set up in order to characterize the queries and individual cases then terms are given as values to each the similarity measure between cases commonly used is defined using the rate at which the values provided from the corresponding indices match in practice however values cannot be expected to be mutually exclusive as a result a natural expansion of this approach is to have relationships in which mutually similar meanings are reflected in the similarity measure between cases in this paper the authors consider an auto fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between corresponding indices and a cross fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between mutually distinct indices then defines a similarity measure between cases which considers the relationship of index values based on these thesauri this definition satisfies the characteristics required for the operation of case based retrieval even when one value is not necessarily given in the index finally using a test similar case retrieval system the authors perform a comparative analysis of the proposed similarity measure between cases and a conventional approach

global action rules in distributed knowledge systems previously z ras and j m zytkow 2000 introduced and investigated query answering system based on distributed knowledge mining the notion of an action rule was introduced by z ras and a wieczorkowska 2000 and its application domain e business was taken in this paper we generalize the notion of action rules in a similar way to handling global queries mainly when values of attributes for a given customer used in action rules can not be easily changed by business user definitions of these attributes are extracted from other sites of a distributed knowledge system to be more precise attributes at every site of a distributed knowledge system are divided into two sets stable and flexible values of flexible attributes for a given consumer sometime can be changed and this change can be influenced and controlled by a business user however some of these changes for instance to the attribute profit can not be done directly to a chosen attribute in this case definitions of such an attribute in terms of other attributes have to be learned these new definitions are used to construct action rules showing what changes in values of flexible attributes for a given consumer are needed in order to re classify this consumer the way business user wants but business user may be either unable or unwilling to proceed with actions leading to such changes in all such cases we may search for definitions of these flexible attributes looking at either local or remote sites for help
towards an ontology of approximate reason this article introduces structural aspects in an ontology of approximate reason the basic assumption in this ontology is that approximate reason is a capability of an agent agents are designed to classify information granules derived from sensors that respond to stimuli in the environment of an agent or received from other agents classification of information granules is carried out in the context of parameterized approximation spaces and a calculus of granules judgment in agents is a faculty of thinking about classifying the particular relative to decision rules derived from data judgment in agents is reflective but not in the classical philosophical sense e g the notion of judgment in kant in an agent a reflective judgment itself is an assertion that a particular decision rule derived from data is applicable to an object input that is a reflective judgment by an agent is an assertion that a particular vector of attribute sensor values matches to some degree the conditions for a particular rule in effect this form of judgment is an assertion that a vector of sensor values reflects a known property of data expressed by a decision rule since the reasoning underlying a reflective judgment is inductive and surjective not based on a priori conditions or universals this form of judgment is reflective but not in the sense of kant unlike kant a reflective judgment is surjective in the sense that it maps experimental attribute values onto the most closely matching descriptors conditions in a derived rule again unlike kant s notion of judgment a reflective judgment is not the result of searching for a universal that pertains to a particular set of values of descriptors rather a reflective judgment by an agent is a form of recognition that a particular vector of sensor values pertains to a particular rule in some degree this recognition takes the form of an assertion that a particular descriptor vector is associated with a particular decision rule these considerations can be repeated for other forms of classifiers besides those defined by decision rules

completeness of timed mu crl previously a straightforward extension of the process algebra mu crl was proposed to explicitly deal with time the process algebra mu crl has been especially designed to deal with data in a process algebraic context using the features for data only a minor extension of the language was needed to obtain a very expressive variant of time previously it contained syntax operational semantics and axioms characterising timed mu crl it did not contain an in depth analysis of theory of timed mu crl this paper fills this gap by providing soundness and completeness results the main tool to establish these is a mapping of timed to untimed mu crl and employing the completeness results obtained for untimed mu crl

integrate and fire neurons driven by correlated stochastic input neurons are sensitive to correlations among synaptic inputs however analytical models that explicitly include correlations are hard to solve analytically so their influence on a neuron s response has been difficult to ascertain to gain some intuition on this problem we studied the firing times of two simple integrate and fire model neurons driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input current analytic expressions were obtained for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation a measure of spike train variability as functions of the mean variance and correlation time of the stochastic input the results of computer simulations were in excellent agreement with these expressions in these models an increase in correlation time in general produces an increase in both the average firing rate and the variability of the output spike trains however the magnitude of the changes depends differentially on the relative values of the input mean and variance the increase in firing rate is higher when the variance is large relative to the mean whereas the increase in variability is higher when the variance is relatively small in addition the firing rate always tends to a finite limit value as the correlation time increases toward infinity whereas the coefficient of variation typically diverges these results suggest that temporal correlations may play a major role in determining the variability as well as the intensity of neuronal spike trains
dynamics of the firing probability of noisy integrate and fire neurons cortical neurons in vivo undergo a continuous bombardment due to synaptic activity which acts as a major source of noise we investigate the effects of the noise filtering by synapses with various levels of realism on integrate and fire neuron dynamics the noise input is modeled by white for instantaneous synapses or colored for synapses with a finite relaxation time noise analytical results for the modulation of firing probability in response to an oscillatory input current are obtained by expanding a fokker planck equation for small parameters of the problem when both the amplitude of the modulation is small compared to the background firing rate and the synaptic time constant is small compared to the membrane time constant we report the detailed calculations showing that if a synaptic decay time constant is included in the synaptic current model the firing rate modulation of the neuron due to an oscillatory input remains finite in the high frequency limit with no phase lag in addition we characterize the low frequency behavior and the behavior of the high frequency limit for intermediate decay times we also characterize the effects of introducing a rise time to the synaptic currents and the presence of several synaptic receptors with different kinetics in both cases we determine using numerical simulations an effective decay time constant that describes the neuronal response completely
reply to carreira perpinan and goodhill mathematics in biology in a paper by carreira perpinan and goodhill see ibid vol 14 no 7 p 1545 60 2002 the authors apply mathematical arguments to biology swindale et al think it is inappropriate to apply the standards of proof required in mathematics to the acceptance or rejection of scientific hypotheses to give some examples showing that data are well described by a linear model does not rule out an infinity of other possible models that might give better descriptions of the data proving in a mathematical sense that the linear model was correct would require ruling out all other possible models a hopeless task similarly to demonstrate that two dna samples come from the same individual it is sufficient to show a match between only a few regions of the genome even though there remains a very large number of additional comparisons that could be done any one of which might potentially disprove the match this is unacceptable in mathematics but in the real world it is a perfectly reasonable basis for belief
center crossing recurrent neural networks for the evolution of rhythmic behavior a center crossing recurrent neural network is one in which the null hyper surfaces of each neuron intersect at their exact centers of symmetry ensuring that each neuron s activation function is centered over the range of net inputs that it receives we demonstrate that relative to a random initial population seeding the initial population of an evolutionary search with center crossing networks significantly improves both the frequency and the speed with which high fitness oscillatory circuits evolve on a simple walking task the improvement is especially striking at low mutation variances our results suggest that seeding with center crossing networks may often be beneficial since a wider range of dynamics is more likely to be easily accessible from a population of center crossing networks than from a population of random networks

understanding internet traffic streams dragonflies and tortoises we present the concept of network traffic streams and the ways they aggregate into flows through internet links we describe a method of measuring the size and lifetime of internet streams and use this method to characterize traffic distributions at two different sites we find that although most streams about 45 percent of them are dragonflies lasting less than 2 seconds a significant number of streams have lifetimes of hours to days and can carry a high proportion 50 60 percent of the total bytes on a given link we define tortoises as streams that last longer than 15 minutes we point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime dragonflies and tortoises but also by size mice and elephants and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions we submit that isps need to be aware of the distribution of internet stream sizes and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams in particular any forwarding cache mechanisms in internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams in addition isps should realize that long running streams can contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes something they may not have allowed for when using traditional flat rate user bandwidth consumption approaches to provisioning and engineering

securing the internet routing infrastructure the unprecedented growth of the internet over the last years and the expectation of an even faster increase in the numbers of users and networked systems resulted in the internet assuming its position as a mass communication medium at the same time the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure however as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows its security becomes a major concern in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure in particular the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks the injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols with a variety of countermeasures which nonetheless have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure in this article we survey the up to date secure routing schemes that appeared over the last few years our critical point of view and thorough review of the literature are an attempt to identify directions for future research on an indeed difficult and still largely open problem

l sub p stability and linearization a theorem by hadamard gives a two part condition under which a map from one banach space to another is a homeomorphism the theorem while often very useful is incomplete in the sense that it does not explicitly specify the family of maps for which the condition is met recently under a typically weak additional assumption on the map it was shown that hadamard s condition is met if and only if the map is a homeomorphism with a lipschitz continuous inverse here an application is given concerning the relation between the l sub p stability with 1 or p infinity of a nonlinear system and the stability of related linear systems we also give a result that directs attention to a fundamental limitation concerning what can be proved about linearization and stability for a related familiar family of feedback systems

a model of periodic oscillation for genetic regulatory systems in this paper we focus on modeling and explaining periodic oscillations in gene protein systems with a simple nonlinear model and on analyzing effects of time delay on the stability of oscillations our main model of genetic regulation comprises of a two gene system with an autoregulatory feedback loop we exploit multiple time scales and hysteretic properties of the model to construct periodic oscillations with jumping dynamics and analyze the possible mechanism according to the singular perturbation theory as shown in this paper periodic oscillations are mainly generated by nonlinearly negative and positive feedback loops in gene regulatory systems whereas the jumping dynamics is generally caused by time scale differences among biochemical reactions this simple model may actually act as a genetic oscillator or switch in gene protein networks because the dynamics are robust for parameter perturbations or environment variations we also explore effects of time delay on the stability of the dynamics showing that the time delay generally increases the stability region of the oscillations thereby making the oscillations robust to parameter changes two examples are also provided to numerically demonstrate our theoretical results

elastically adaptive deformable models we present a technique for the automatic adaptation of a deformable model s elastic parameters within a kalman filter framework for shape estimation applications the novelty of the technique is that the model s elastic parameters are not constant but spatio temporally varying the variation of the elastic parameters depends on the distance of the model from the data and the rate of change of this distance each pass of the algorithm uses physics based modeling techniques to iteratively adjust both the geometric and the elastic degrees of freedom of the model in response to forces that are computed from the discrepancy between the model and the data by augmenting the state equations of an extended kalman filter to incorporate these additional variables we are able to significantly improve the quality of the shape estimation therefore the model s elastic parameters are always initialized to the same value and they are subsequently modified depending on the data and the noise distribution we present results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for both two dimensional and three dimensional data

process planning for reliable high speed machining of moulds a method of generating nc programs for the high speed milling of moulds is investigated forging dies and injection moulds whether plastic or aluminium have a complex surface geometry in addition they are made of steels of hardness as much as 30 or even 50 hrc since 1995 high speed machining has been much adopted by the die making industry which with this technology can reduce its use of sinking electrodischarge machining sedm edm in general calls for longer machining times the use of high speed machining makes it necessary to redefine the preliminary stages of the process in addition it affects the methodology employed in the generation of nc programs which requires the use of high level cam software the aim is to generate error free programs that make use of optimum cutting strategies in the interest of productivity and surface quality the final result is a more reliable manufacturing process there are two risks in the use of high speed milling on hardened steels one of these is tool breakage which may be very costly and may furthermore entail marks on the workpiece the other is collisions between the tool and the workpiece or fixtures the result of which may be damage to the ceramic bearings in the spindles in order to minimize these risks it is necessary that new control and optimization steps be included in the cam methodology there are three things that the firm adopting high speed methods should do it should redefine its process engineering it should systematize access by its cam programmers to high speed knowhow and it should take up the use of process simulation tools in the latter case it will be very advantageous to use tools for the estimation of cutting forces the new work methods proposed in this article have made it possible to introduce high speed milling hsm into the die industry examples are given of how the technique has been applied with cam programming re engineered as here proposed with an explanation of the novel features and the results
heuristics for single pass welding task sequencing welding task sequencing is a prerequisite in the offline programming of robot arc welding single pass welding task sequencing can be modelled as a modified travelling salesman problem owing to the difficulty of the resulting arc routing problems effective local search heuristics are developed computational speed becomes important because robot arc welding is often part of an automated process planning procedure generating a reasonable solution in an acceptable time is necessary for effective automated process planning several different heuristics are proposed for solving the welding task sequencing problem considering both productivity and the potential for welding distortion constructive heuristics based on the nearest neighbour concept and tabu search heuristics are developed and enhanced using improvement procedures the effectiveness of the heuristics developed is tested and verified on actual welded structure problems and random problems
an adaptive sphere fitting method for sequential tolerance control the machining of complex parts typically involves a logical and chronological sequence of n operations on m machine tools because manufacturing datums cannot always match design constraints some of the design specifications imposed on the part are usually satisfied by distinct subsets of the n operations prescribed in the process plan conventional tolerance control specifies a fixed set point for each operation and a permissible variation about this set point to insure compliance with the specifications whereas sequential tolerance control stc uses real time measurement information at the completion of one stage to reposition the set point for subsequent operations however it has been shown that earlier sphere fitting methods for stc can lead to inferior solutions when the process distributions are skewed this paper introduces an extension of stc that uses an adaptive sphere fitting method that significantly improves the yield in the presence of skewed distributions as well as significantly reducing the computational effort required by earlier probabilistic search methods

evaluation of the usability of digital maintenance manuals developed without either user input or a task analysis the primary objective was to investigate the value that can be added to a low cost digital maintenance manual by the addition of a navigational aid two versions of a digital maintenance manual were developed the difference between them being the number of design heuristics observed when designing navigational aids neither version was based on an analysis of the tasks carried out by users nor were users involved in the design process instead the manuals were developed directly from the digital information used to produce the existing paper manual usability trials were carried out to test both versions according to the time taken and errors committed by users during typical information retrieval tasks users were questioned to determine their ease of use eou perceptions for each manual the main outcomes were that the navigation aid used in the second version reduced the time taken to use the manual but increased the number of errors made by users the navigational aid also seemed to reduce the perceived eou compared with the first version in both cases the perceived eou was lower than for a previous digital manual that had been developed using a task analysis and user input the paper concludes by recommending the development of a generic task model of user interaction with digital maintenance manuals

optical actuation of a bistable mems this paper presents an optical actuation scheme for mems devices based on the well established fact that light possesses momentum and hence imparts a force equal to 2 w c when reflected by a surface here w is the total power of the reflected light and c is the speed of light radiation pressure as it is known is nearly insignificant for most macroscale applications but it can be quite significant for mems devices in addition light actuation offers a new paradigm first intersecting light beams do not interfere in contrast to electrical conductors which short when they come into contact second light can operate in high temperature and high radiation environments far outside the capability of solid state electronic components this actuation method is demonstrated both in air and in vacuum by switching the state of a bistable mems device the associated heat transfer model is also presented
a feature preserving volumetric technique to merge surface triangulations several extensions and improvements to surface merging procedures based on the extraction of isosurfaces from a distance map defined on an adaptive background grid are presented the main objective is to extend the application of these algorithms to surfaces with sharp edges and comers in order to deal with objects of different length scales the initial background grids are created using a delaunay triangulation method and local voxelizations a point enrichment technique that introduces points into the background grid along detected surface features such as ridges is used to ensure that these features are preserved in the final merged surface the surface merging methodology is extended to include other boolean operations between surface triangulations the iso surface extraction algorithms are modified to obtain the correct iso surface for multi component objects the procedures are demonstrated with various examples ranging from simple geometrical entities to complex engineering applications the present algorithms allow realistic modelling of a large number of complex engineering geometries using overlapping components defined discretely i e via surface triangulations this capability is very useful for grid generation starting from data originated in measurements or images
an augmented spatial digital tree algorithm for contact detection in computational mechanics based on the understanding of existing spatial digital tree based contact detection approaches and the alternating digital tree adt algorithm in particular a more efficient algorithm termed the augmented spatial digital tree asdt algorithm is proposed in the present work the asdt algorithm adopts a different point representation scheme that uses only the lower comer vertex to represent a hyper rectangle with the upper comer vertex serving as the augmented information consequently the asdt algorithm can keep the working space the same as the original n dimensional space and in general a much better balanced tree can be expected this together with the introduction of an additional bounding subregion for the rectangles associated with each tree node makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of node visits in the region search although each node visit may be slightly more expensive three examples arising in computational mechanics are presented to provide an assessment of the performance of the asdt the numerical results indicate that the asdt is at least over 3 9 times faster than the adt
loop restructuring for data i o minimization on limited on chip memory embedded processors in this paper we propose a framework for analyzing the flow of values and their reuse in loop nests to minimize data traffic under the constraints of limited on chip memory capacity and dependences our analysis first undertakes fusion of possible loop nests intra procedurally and then performs loop distribution the analysis discovers the closeness factor of two statements which is a quantitative measure of data traffic saved per unit memory occupied if the statements were under the same loop nest over the case where they are under different loop nests we then develop a greedy algorithm which traverses the program dependence graph to group statements together under the same loop nest legally to promote maximal reuse per unit of memory occupied we implemented our framework in petit a tool for dependence analysis and loop transformations we compared our method with one based on tiling of fused loop nest and one based on a greedy strategy to purely maximize reuse we show that our methods work better than both of these strategies in most cases for processors such as tms320cxx which have a very limited amount of on chip memory the improvements in data i o range from 10 to 30 percent over tiling and from 10 to 40 percent over maximal reuse for jpeg loops
semantic data broadcast for a mobile environment based on dynamic and adaptive chunking database broadcast is an effective and scalable approach to disseminate information of high affinity to a large collection of mobile clients a common problem of existing broadcast approaches is the lack of knowledge for a client to determine if all data items satisfying its query could be obtained from the broadcast we therefore propose a semantic based broadcast approach a semantic descriptor is attached to each broadcast unit called a data chunk this semantic descriptor allows a client to determine if a query can be answered entirely based on broadcast items and if needed identify the precise definition of the remaining items in the form of a supplementary query data chunks can be of static or dynamic sizes and organized hierarchically their boundary can be determined on the fly adaptive to the nature of client queries we investigate different ways of organizing the data chunks over a broadcast channel to improve access performance we introduce the data affinity index metric which more accurately reflects client perceived performance a simulation model is built to evaluate our semantic based broadcast schemes
data allocation on wireless broadcast channels for efficient query processing data broadcast is an excellent method for efficient data dissemination in the mobile computing environment the application domain of data broadcast will be widely expanded in the near future where the client is expected to perform complex queries or transactions on the broadcast data to reduce the access latency for processing the complex query it is beneficial to place the data accessed in a query close to each other on the broadcast channel in this paper we propose an efficient algorithm to determine the allocation of the data on the broadcast channel such that frequently co accessed data are not only allocated close to each other but also in a particular order which optimizes the performance of query processing our mechanism is based on the well known problem named optimal linear ordering experiments are performed to justify the benefit of our approach
cache invalidation and replacement strategies for location dependent data in mobile environments mobile location dependent information services ldiss have become increasingly popular in recent years however data caching strategies for ldiss have thus far received little attention in this paper we study the issues of cache invalidation and cache replacement for location dependent data under a geometric location model we introduce a new performance criterion called caching efficiency and propose a generic method for location dependent cache invalidation strategies in addition two cache replacement policies pa and paid are proposed unlike the conventional replacement policies pa and paid take into consideration the valid scope area of a data value we conduct a series of simulation experiments to study the performance of the proposed caching schemes the experimental results show that the proposed location dependent invalidation scheme is very effective and the pa and paid policies significantly outperform the conventional replacement policies

subject access to government documents in an era of globalization intellectual bundling of entities affected by the decisions of supranational organizations as a result of the growing influence of supranational organizations there is a need for a new model for subject access to government information in academic libraries rulings made by supranational bodies such as the world trade organization wto and rulings determined under the auspices of transnational economic agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta often supersede existing law resulting in obligatory changes to national provincial state and municipal legislation just as important is the relationship among private sector companies third party actors such as nongovernmental organizations ngos and governments the interaction among the various entities affected by supranational rulings could potentially form the basis of a new model for subject access to government information
work in progress developing policies for access to government information in the new south africa following south africa s transition to democracy in 1994 the sa government has adopted policies supporting freedom of expression and freedom of access to information the bill of rights in the new constitution includes a constitutional right of access to information held by the state since 1994 various initiatives have been taken by government and other bodies to promote such access these include moves to reorganize government printing and publishing restructure the government s public information services make government information available on the internet and extend telephony and internet access to poor communities sa s new legal deposit act 1997 makes provision for the creation of official publications depositories the promotion of access to information act 2000 was enacted to ensure access to information held by the state and public bodies however despite much activity it has proved difficult to translate principles into practical and well coordinated measures to improve access to government information a specific concern is the failure of policy makers to visualize a role for libraries
construction of double sampling s control charts for agile manufacturing double sampling ds x control charts are designed to allow quick detection of a small shift of process mean and provides a quick response in an agile manufacturing environment however the ds x control charts assume that the process standard deviation remains unchanged throughout the entire course of the statistical process control therefore a complementary ds chart that can be used to monitor the process variation caused by changes in process standard deviation should be developed in this paper the development of the ds s charts for quickly detecting small shift in process standard deviation for agile manufacturing is presented the construction of the ds s charts is based on the same concepts in constructing the ds x charts and is formulated as an optimization problem and solved with a genetic algorithm the efficiency of the ds s control chart is compared with that of the traditional s control chart the results show that the ds s control charts can be a more economically preferable alternative in detecting small shifts than traditional s control charts
computer program for calculating the p value in testing process capability index c sub pmk many process capability indices including c sub p c sub pk and c sub pm have been proposed to provide numerical measures on the process potential and performance combining the advantages of these indices pearn et al 1992 introduced a new capability index called c sub pmk which has been shown to be a useful capability index for processes with two sided specification limits in this paper the authors implement the theory of a testing hypothesis using the natural estimator of c sub pmk and provide an efficient maple computer program to calculate the p values they also provide tables of the critical values for some commonly used capability requirements based on the test they develop a simple step by step procedure for in plant applications the practitioners can use the proposed procedure to determine whether their process meets the preset capability requirement and make reliable decisions

the disconnect continues digital content providers the relationships between the people who buy digital content and those who sell it are probably more acrimonious than ever before says dick curtis a director and lead analyst for the research firm outsell inc where he covers econtent contract and negotiation strategies several buyers agree with his observation they cite aggressive sales tactics an unwillingness to deliver content in formats buyers need a reluctance to provide licensing terms that take into account the structure of today s corporations and inadequate service and support as a few of the factors underlying the acrimony still many buyers remain optimistic that compromises can be reached on some of these issues but first they say sellers must truly understand the econtent needs of today s enterprises
look into the future of content management predictions of consolidation in the content management cm vendor arena have appeared in nearly every major industry prognosis over the past two years gartner group for example recently reiterated its prediction that half the cm vendors in existence in mid 2001 would leave the marketplace by the end of 2002 analysts consistently advise prospective cm buyers to tread carefully because their vendor may not stick around but fortunately the story goes fewer vendor choices will finally bring greater clarity and sharper differentiators to this otherwise very messy product landscape in fact the number of cm vendors continues to rise industry growth has come through greater demand among cm buyers but also expanding product functionality as well as successful partnerships the marketplace certainly cannot sustain its current breadth of vendors in the long run yet it remains unclear when and how any serious industry consolidation will occur in the meantime evolving business models and feature sets have created just the kind of clearer segmentation and transparent product differences that were supposed to emerge following an industry contraction

the free lunch is over online content subscriptions on the rise high need rather than high use may be what really determines a user s willingness to pay retooling and targeting content may be a sharper strategy than trying to re educate users that it is time to pay up for material that has been free waiting for a paradigm shift in general user attitudes about paying for online content could be a fool s errand
cataloguing to help law library users the author takes a broader view of the catalogue than is usual we can include within it items that have locations other than the office library itself this may well start with internet resources but can perfectly appropriately continue with standard works not held in the immediate collection but available in some other accessible collection such as the local reference library the essential feature is to include entries for the kind of material sought by users with the addition of a location mark indicating where they can find it
to classify or not to classify that is the question in addressing classification issues the librarian needs to decide what best suits the purpose and requirements of the user group and the organisation they work in the author has used the well established moys classification scheme this gives the level of detail required for current stock and allows for the incorporation of new material as the firm s specialisations develop the scheme is widely used in other firms as well as in the local law society library so it will be familiar to many users
the role and future of subject classification the exploitation of resources it is imperative that the library information systems lis profession and lis educators appreciate fully the contribution that classification makes to the discipline and that it is no longer seen as the domain of the academic isolated theorist but becomes an integral part of our understanding of the contribution that the lis community can make to society as a whole as well as to particular areas such as legal information
a simple etalon stabilized visible laser diode visible laser diodes lds are inexpensively available with single transverse mode single longitudinal mode operation with a coherence length in the metre range with constant current bias and constant operating temperature the optical output power and operating wavelength are stable a simple and inexpensive way is developed to maintain a constant ld temperature as the temperature of the local environment varies by monitoring the initially changing wavelength with an external etalon and using this information to apply a heating correction to the monitor photodiode commonly integral to the ld package the fractional wavelength stability achieved is limited by the solid etalon to 7 10 sup 6 degrees c sup 1
experimental investigations on monitoring and control of induction heating process for semi solid alloys using the heating coil as sensor a method of monitoring the state of metal alloys during induction heating and control of the heating process utilizing the heating coil itself as a sensor is proposed and its usefulness and effectiveness were experimentally investigated using aluminium a357 billets for the semi solid metal ssm casting processes the impedance of the coil containing the billet was continuously measured by the proposed method in the temperature range between room temperature and 700 degrees c it was found that the reactance component of the impedance varied distinctively according to the billet state and could clearly monitor the deformation of the billet while the resistance component increased with temperature reflecting the variation of the resistivity of the billet which has strong correlation to the solid liquid fraction of the billets the measured impedance is very sensitive to the billet states such as temperature deformation and solid liquid fraction and could be used as a parameter to monitor and control the heating process for ssms
modelling tomographic cone beam projection data from a polyhedral phantom analytical phantoms are used to generate projection data for testing reconstruction accuracy in computed axial tomography a circular source locus equivalent to rotating specimen with a fixed source provides insufficient data for exact reconstruction in cone beam transmission tomography thus phantom data are useful for studying the consequent errors and also for investigating alternative scanning loci and reconstruction techniques we present an algorithm that can compute phantom cone beam projection data from a phantom comprising geometrically defined polyhedra each polyhedron is defined as a set of polygons enclosing a volume of fixed linear attenuation coefficient the algorithm works by projecting each polygon in turn onto the modelled detector array which accumulates the product of source to polygon intersection distance for the rays intersecting each detector element linear attenuation coefficient and sign of projected polygon area indicating whether rays enter or exit the polyhedron at this face the phantom data are rotated according to the projection angle whilst the source location and detector plane remain fixed polyhedra can be of simple geometric form or complex surfaces derived from 3d images of real specimens this algorithm is illustrated using a phantom comprising 989 238 polygons representing an iso surface generated from a microtomographic reconstruction of a piece of walrus tusk

three dimensional particle image tracking for dilute particle liquid flows in a pipe a three dimensional 3d particle image tracking technique was used to study the coarse spherical particle liquid flows in a pipe the flow images from both the front view and the normal side view which was reflected into the front view by a mirror were recorded with a ccd camera and digitized by a pc with an image grabber card an image processing program was developed to enhance and segment the flow image and then to identify the particles over 90 of all the particles can be identified and located from the partially overlapped particle images using the circular hough transform then the 3d position of each detected particle was determined by matching its front view image to its side view image the particle velocity was then obtained by pairing its images in successive video fields the measurements for the spherical expanded polystyrene particle oil flows show that the particles like the spherical bubbles in laminar bubbly flows tend to conglomerate near the pipe wall and to line up to form the particle clusters as liquid velocity decreases the particle clusters disperse and more particles are distributed in the pipe centre region
on line robust processing techniques for elimination of measurement drop out when processing measurement data it is usually assumed that some amount of normally distributed measurement noise is present in some situations outliers are present in the measurements and consequently the noise is far from normally distributed in this case classical least squares procedures for estimating fourier spectra or derived quantities like the frequency response function can give results which are inaccurate or even useless in this paper a novel technique for the on line processing of measurement outliers will be proposed both the computation speed and the accuracy of the technique presented will be compared with different classical approaches for handling outliers in measurement data i e filtering techniques outlier rejection techniques and robust regression techniques in particular all processing techniques will be validated by applying them to the problem of speckle drop out in optical vibration measurements performed with a laser doppler vibrometer which typically causes outliers in the measurements

handles and exception safety part 1 a simple handle class every c program that uses inheritance must manage memory somehow the most obvious way to do so is directly but programmers who create complicated data structures often have trouble figuring out what parts of those data structures are safe to delete when the classical method of dealing with such complexity is to hide it in a class such classes are typically called handles the idea is to attach a handle object to another object that contains the actual data the simplest form of a handle which we have discussed in this article is one in which each handle object corresponds to a single object from the inheritance hierarchy such handles are straightforward to use and to implement and tend to be intrinsically exception safe in almost all respects the one exception hazard in such a class is typically the assignment operator assignment operators often test for self assignment to avoid aliasing problems as herb sutter has observed 2000 programs that need such tests are almost always exception unsafe by rewriting the assignment operator we ensure that we do not do anything irrevocable until the possibility of throwing an exception has passed this strategy ensures that if an exception occurs while our assignment operator is executing we do not corrupt the rest of our system
using constructed types in c unions the c standard states that a union type cannot have a member with a nontrivial constructor or destructor while at first this seems unreasonable further thought makes it clear why this is the case the crux of the problem is that unions don t have built in semantics for denoting when a member is the current member of the union therefore the compiler can t know when it s appropriate to call constructors or destructors on the union members still there are good reasons for wanting to use constructed object types in a union for example you might want to implement a scripting language with a single variable type that can either be an integer a string or a list a union is the perfect candidate for implementing such a composite type but the restriction on constructed union members may prevent you from using an existing string or list class for example from the stl to provide the underlying functionality luckily a feature of c called placement new can provide a workaround
c and c a case for compatibility modern c and c are sibling languages descended from classic c in many people s minds they are wrongly but understandably fused into the mythical c c programming language there is no c c language but there is a c c community previously the author described some of the incompatibilities that complicate the work of developers within that c c community in this article he discusses some of the underlying myths that help perpetuate these incompatibilities he also shows why more compatibility ideally full compatibility is in the best interest of the c c community in the next paper he presents some examples of how the incompatibilities in c and c might be resolved

the tattletale technique practical experience has taught many java developers one thing critical resources mutexes database connections transactions file handles etc require timely and systematic release unfortunately java s garbage collector is not up to that job according to the java language specification there are no guarantees when a garbage collector will run when it will collect an object or when it will finalize an object if ever even more unfortunately java s counterpart to the c destructor the finally block is both tedious and error prone requiring developers to constantly remember and duplicate resource releasing code consequently even good java developers can forget to release critical resources there is a light at the end of the tunnel java may make it easier to leak critical resources but it also provides the necessary mechanisms to easily track them down the tattletale technique is a simple method for designing new classes and retrofitting existing classes to quickly and easily detect the offending code responsible for leaking resources
international swinging making swing components locale sensitive although java and its gui library swing provide software developers with a highly customizable framework for creating truly international applications the swing library is not sensitive to locale switches it cannot automatically change an application s appearance to conform to the conventions of a specific locale at run time several types of applications benefit from the ability to easily switch the language at run time training applications and other programs that run on computers in public spaces such as libraries airports or government offices may need to support multiple languages other applications like travel dictionaries or translation programs are inherently multilingual and are specifically designed to support users of dissimilar tongues such applications would greatly benefit if the user interface language could be customized at run time the article shows you how to customize swing to support locale switching at run time the author has created a new look and feel called the mlmetallookandfeel where ml stands for multilingual this new look and feel extends the standard metal look and feel but is locale sensitive at run time
implementing equals for mixed type comparison the idea of comparing objects of different types is not entirely off base in particular for classes from the same class hierarchy after all objects from the same class hierarchy and by class hierarchy we mean all classes derived from a common superclass other than object have something in common namely at least the superclass part as we demonstrated in a previous paper 2002 providing a correct implementation of a mixed type comparison is a non trivial task in this article we will show one way of implementing a mixed type comparison of objects from the same class hierarchy that meets the requirements of the equals contract
raising the standard of management education for electronic commerce professionals the teaching of electronic commerce in universities has become a growth industry in itself the rapid expansion of electronic commerce programmes raises the question of what actually is being taught the association of electronic commerce as primarily a technical or information technology it phenomenon has not been sufficient to constrain it to it and information systems departments business schools have been keen entrants into the electronic commerce coursework race and they are developing electronic commerce programmes in an environment where there is no agreed definition of the term this paper draws on the work of kenneth boulding who argued that the dynamics of change in society are largely a product of changing skills and the way these skills are arranged into roles at the organizational level it is argued that an overly technical interpretation of electronic commerce narrows the skills being acquired as part of formal education universities under pressure from the market and technological change are changing their roles resulting in a further narrowing of the breadth of issues that is seen as legitimate to be included as electronic commerce the outcome is that aspiring electronic commerce professionals are not being exposed to a wide enough agenda of ideas and concepts that will assist them to make better business decisions

computational complexity of probabilistic disambiguation recent models of natural language processing employ statistical reasoning for dealing with the ambiguity of formal grammars in this approach statistics concerning the various linguistic phenomena of interest are gathered from actual linguistic data and used to estimate the probabilities of the various entities that are generated by a given grammar e g derivations parse trees and sentences the extension of grammars with probabilities makes it possible to state ambiguity resolution as a constrained optimization formula which aims at maximizing the probability of some entity that the grammar generates given the input e g maximum probability parse tree given some input sentence the implementation of these optimization formulae in efficient algorithms however does not always proceed smoothly in this paper we address the computational complexity of ambiguity resolution under various kinds of probabilistic models we provide proofs that some frequently occurring problems of ambiguity resolution are np complete these problems are encountered in various applications e g language understanding for textand speech based applications assuming the common model of computation this result implies that for many existing probabilistic models it is not possible to devise tractable algorithms for solving these optimization problems
lr parsing for conjunctive grammars the generalized lr parsing algorithm for context free grammars introduced by tomita in 1986 is a polynomial time implementation of nondeterministic lr parsing that uses graph structured stack to represent the contents of the nondeterministic parser s pushdown for all possible branches of computation at a single computation step it has been specifically developed as a solution for practical parsing tasks arising in computational linguistics and indeed has proved itself to be very suitable for natural language processing conjunctive grammars extend context free grammars by allowing the use of an explicit intersection operation within grammar rules this paper develops a new lr style parsing algorithm for these grammars which is based on the very same idea of a graph structured pushdown where the simultaneous existence of several paths in the graph is used to perform the mentioned intersection operation the underlying finite automata are treated in the most general way instead of showing the algorithm s correctness for some particular way of constructing automata the paper defines a wide class of automata usable with a given grammar which includes not only the traditional lr k automata but also for instance a trivial automaton with a single reachable state a modification of the slr k table construction method that makes use of specific properties of conjunctive grammars is provided as one possible way of making finite automata to use with the algorithm

surface textures improve the robustness of stereoscopic depth cues this research develops design recommendations for surface textures patterns of color on object surfaces rendered with stereoscopic displays in 3 method of adjustment procedure experiments 8 participants matched the disparity of a circular probe and a planar stimulus rendered using a single visible edge the experiments varied stimulus orientation and surface texture participants more accurately matched the depth of vertical stimuli than that of horizontal stimuli consistent with previous studies and existing theory participants matched the depth of surfaces with large pixel to pixel luminance variations more accurately than they did surfaces with a small pixel to pixel luminance variation finally they matched the depth of surfaces with vertical line patterns more accurately than they did surfaces with horizontal striped texture patterns these results suggest that designers can enhance depth perception in stereoscopic displays and also reduce undesirable sensitivity to orientation by rendering objects with surface textures using large pixel to pixel luminance variations
control performance with three translational degrees of freedom for multiple degree of freedom dof systems it is important to determine how accurately operators can control each dof and what influence perceptual information processing and psychomotor components have on performance sixteen right handed male students participated in 2 experiments 1 involving positioning and 1 involving tracking with 3 translational dofs to separate perceptual and psychomotor effects we used 2 control display mappings that differed in the coupling of vertical and depth dimensions to the up down and fore aft control axes we observed information processing effects in the positioning task initial error correction on the vertical dimension lagged in time behind the horizontal dimension the depth dimension error correction lagged behind both which was ascribed to the poorer perceptual information we observed this perceptual effect also in the tracking experiment motor effects were also present with tracking errors along the up down axis of the hand controller being 1 1 times larger than along the fore aft axis these results indicate that all 3 components contribute to control performance actual applications of this research include interface design
contrast sensitivity in a dynamic environment effects of target conditions and visual impairment contrast sensitivity was determined as a function of target velocity 0 degrees 120 degrees s over a variety of viewing conditions in experiment 1 measurements of dynamic contrast sensitivity were determined for observers as a function of target velocity for letter stimuli significant main effects were found for target velocity target size and target duration but significant interactions among the variables indicated especially pronounced adverse effects of increasing target velocity for small targets and brief durations in experiment 2 the effects of simulated cataracts were determined although the simulated impairment had no effect on traditional acuity scores dynamic contrast sensitivity was markedly reduced results are discussed in terms of dynamic contrast sensitivity as a useful composite measure of visual functioning that may provide a better overall picture of an individual s visual functioning than does traditional static acuity dynamic acuity or contrast sensitivity alone the measure of dynamic contrast sensitivity may increase understanding of the practical effects of various conditions such as aging or disease on the visual system or it may allow improved prediction of individuals performance in visually dynamic situations
relation between glare and driving performance the present study investigated the effects of discomfort glare on driving behavior participants old and young us and europeans were exposed to a simulated low beam light source mounted on the hood of an instrumented vehicle participants drove at night in actual traffic along a track consisting of urban rural and highway stretches the results show that the relatively low glare source caused a significant drop in detecting simulated pedestrians along the roadside and made participants drive significantly slower on dark and winding roads older participants showed the largest drop in pedestrian detection performance and reduced their driving speed the most the results indicate that the de boer rating scale the most commonly used rating scale for discomfort glare is practically useless as a predictor of driving performance furthermore the maximum us headlamp intensity 1380 cd per headlamp appears to be an acceptable upper limit
the perceived utility of human and automated aids in a visual detection task although increases in the use of automation have occurred across society research has found that human operators often underutilize disuse and overly rely on misuse automated aids parasuraman riley 1997 nearly 275 cameron university students participated in 1 of 3 experiments performed to examine the effects of perceived utility dzindolet et al 2001 on automation use in a visual detection task and to compare reliance on automated aids with reliance on humans results revealed a bias for human operators to rely on themselves although self report data indicate a bias toward automated aids over human aids performance data revealed that participants were more likely to disuse automated aids than to disuse human aids this discrepancy was accounted for by assuming human operators have a perfect automation schema actual or potential applications of this research include the design of future automated decision aids and training procedures for operators relying on such aids

the effects of work pace on within participant and between participant keying force electromyography and fatigue a laboratory study was conducted to determine the effects of work pace on typing force electromyographic emg activity and subjective discomfort we found that as participants typed faster their typing force and finger flexor and extensor emg activity increased linearly there was also an increase in subjective discomfort with a sharp threshold between participants self selected pace and their maximum typing speed the results suggest that participants self select a typing pace that maximizes typing speed and minimizes discomfort the fastest typists did not produce significantly more finger flexor emg activity but did produce proportionately less finger extensor emg activity compared with the slower typists we hypothesize that fast typists may use different muscle recruitment patterns that allow them to be more efficient than slower typists at striking the keys in addition faster typists do not experience more discomfort than slow typists these findings show that the relative pace of typing is more important than actual typing speed with regard to discomfort and muscle activity these results suggest that typists may benefit from skill training to increase maximum typing speed potential applications of this research includes skill training for typists
agreeing with automated diagnostic aids a study of users concurrence strategies automated diagnostic aids that are less than perfectly reliable often produce unwarranted levels of disuse by operators in the present study users tendencies to either agree or disagree with automated diagnostic aids were examined under conditions in which 1 the aids were less than perfectly reliable but aided diagnosis was still more accurate that unaided diagnosis and 2 the system was completely opaque affording users no additional information upon which to base a diagnosis the results revealed that some users adopted a strategy of always agreeing with the aids thereby maximizing the number of correct diagnoses made over several trials other users however adopted a probability matching strategy in which agreement and disagreement rates matched the rate of correct and incorrect diagnoses of the aids the probability matching strategy therefore resulted in diagnostic accuracy scores that were lower than was maximally possible users who adopted the maximization strategy had higher self ratings of problem solving and decision making skills were more accurate in estimating aid reliabilities and were more confident in their diagnosis on trials in which they agreed with the aids the potential applications of these findings include the design of interface and training solutions that facilitate the adoption of the most effective concurrence strategies by users of automated diagnostic aids

assessment of prehospital chest pain using telecardiology two hundred general practitioners were equipped with a portable electrocardiograph which could transmit a 12 lead electrocardiogram ecg via a telephone line a cardiologist was available 24 h a day for an interactive teleconsultation in a 13 month period there were 5073 calls to the telecardiology service and 952 subjects with chest pain were identified the telecardiology service allowed the general practitioners to manage 700 cases 74 themselves further diagnostic tests were requested for 162 patients 17 and 83 patients 9 were sent to the hospital emergency department in the last group a cardiological diagnosis was confirmed in 60 patients and refuted in 23 seven patients in whom the telecardiology service failed to detect a cardiac problem were hospitalized in the subsequent 48 h the telecardiology service showed a sensitivity of 97 4 a specificity of 89 5 and a diagnostic accuracy of 86 9 for chest pain telemedicine could be a useful tool in the diagnosis of chest pain in primary care
social presence in telemedicine we studied consultations between a doctor emergency nurse practitioners enps and their patients in a minor accident and treatment service mats in the conventional consultations all three people were located at the main hospital in the teleconsultations the doctor was located in a hospital 6 km away from the mats and used a videoconferencing link connected at 384 kbit s there were 30 patients in the conventional group and 30 in the telemedical group the presenting problems were similar in the two groups the mean duration of teleconsultations was 951 s and the mean duration of face to face consultations was 247 s in doctor nurse communication there was a higher rate of turn taking in teleconsultations than in face to face consultations there were also more interruptions more words and more backchannels e g mhm uh huh per teleconsultation in doctor patient communication there was a higher rate of turn taking more words more interruptions and more backchannels per teleconsultation in patient nurse communication there was relatively little difference between the two modes of consulting the doctor telemedicine appeared to empower the patient to ask more questions of the doctor it also seemed that the doctor took greater care in a teleconsultation to achieve coordination of beliefs with the patient than in a face to face consultation
an eight year study of internet based remote medical counselling we carried out a prospective study of an internet based remote counselling service a total of 15 456 internet users visited the web site over eight years from these 1500 users were randomly selected for analysis medical counselling had been granted to 901 of the people requesting it 60 one hundred and sixty four physicians formed project groups to process the requests and responded using email the distribution of patients using the service was similar to the availability of the internet 78 were from the european union north america and australia sixty seven per cent of the patients lived in urban areas and the remainder were residents of remote rural areas with limited local medical coverage sixty five per cent of the requests were about problems of internal medicine and 30 of the requests concerned surgical issues the remaining 5 of the patients sought information about recent developments such as molecular medicine or aviation medicine during the project our portal became inaccessible five times and counselling was not possible on 44 days there was no hacking of the web site internet based medical counselling is a helpful addition to conventional practice
extending kamp s theorem to model time granularity in this paper a generalization of kamp s theorem relative to the functional completeness of the until operator is proved such a generalization consists in showing the functional completeness of more expressive temporal operators with respect to the extension of the first order theory of linear orders mfo with an extra binary relational symbol the result is motivated by the search of a modal language capable of expressing properties and operators suitable to model time granularity in omega layered temporal structures
client satisfaction in a feasibility study comparing face to face interviews with telepsychiatry we carried out a pilot study comparing satisfaction levels between psychiatric patients seen face to face ftf and those seen via videoconference patients who consented were randomly assigned to one of two groups one group received services in person ftf from the visiting psychiatrist while the other was seen using videoconferencing at 128 kbit s one psychiatrist provided all the ftf and videoconferencing assessment and follow up visits a total of 24 subjects were recruited three of the subjects 13 did not attend their appointments and two subjects in each group were lost to follow up thus there were nine in the ftf group and eight in the videoconferencing group the two groups were similar in most respects patient satisfaction with the services was assessed using the client satisfaction questionnaire csq 8 completed four months after the initial consultation the mean scores were 25 3 in the ftf group and 21 6 in the videoconferencing group although there was a trend in favour of the ftf service the difference was not significant patient satisfaction is only one component of evaluation the efficacy of telepsychiatry must also be measured relative to that of conventional ftf care before policy makers can decide how extensively telepsychiatry should be implemented
evaluation of videoconferenced grand rounds we evaluated various aspects of grand rounds videoconferenced from a tertiary care hospital to a regional hospital in nova scotia during a five month study period 29 rounds were broadcast 19 in medicine and 10 in cardiology the total recorded attendance at the remote site was 103 comprising 70 specialists nine family physicians and 24 other health care professionals we received 55 evaluations a response rate of 53 on a five point likert scale on which higher scores indicated better quality mean ratings by remote site participants of the technical quality of the videoconference were 3 0 3 5 with the lowest ratings being for ability to hear the discussion 3 0 and to see visual aids 3 1 mean ratings for content presentation discussion and educational value were 3 8 or higher of the 49 physicians who presented the rounds we received evaluations from 41 a response rate of 84 the presenters rated all aspects of the videoconference and interaction with remote sites at 3 8 or lower the lowest ratings were for ability to see the remote sites 3 0 and the usefulness of the discussion 3 4 we received 278 evaluations from participants at the presenting site an estimated response rate of about 55 the results indicated no adverse opinions of the effect of videoconferencing mean scores 3 1 3 3 the estimated costs of videoconferencing one grand round to one site and four sites were c 723 and c 1515 respectively the study confirmed that videoconferenced rounds can provide satisfactory continuing medical education to community specialists which is an especially important consideration as maintenance of certification becomes mandatory
a systematic review of the efficacy of telemedicine for making diagnostic and management decisions we conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine for making diagnostic and management decisions in three classes of application office hospital based store and forward and home based telemedicine we searched the medline embase cinahl and healthstar databases and printed resources and interviewed investigators in the field we excluded studies where the service did not historically require face to face encounters e g radiology or pathology diagnosis a total of 58 articles met the inclusion criteria the articles were summarized and graded for the quality and direction of the evidence there were very few high quality studies the strongest evidence for the efficacy of telemedicine for diagnostic and management decisions came from the specialties of psychiatry and dermatology there was also reasonable evidence that general medical history and physical examinations performed via telemedicine had relatively good sensitivity and specificity other specialties in which some evidence for efficacy existed were cardiology and certain areas of ophthalmology despite the widespread use of telemedicine in most major medical specialties there is strong evidence in only a few of them that the diagnostic and management decisions provided by telemedicine are comparable to face to face care
research into telehealth applications in speech language pathology a literature review was conducted to investigate the extent to which telehealth has been researched within the domain of speech language pathology and the outcomes of this research a total of 13 studies were identified three early studies demonstrated that telehealth was feasible although there was no discussion of the cost effectiveness of this process in terms of patient outcomes the majority of the subsequent studies indicated positive or encouraging outcomes resulting from telehealth however there were a number of shortcomings in the research including a lack of cost benefit information failure to evaluate the technology itself an absence of studies of the educational and informational aspects of telehealth in relation to speech language pathology and the use of telehealth in a limited range of communication disorders future research into the application of telehealth to speech language pathology services must adopt a scientific approach and have a well defined development and evaluation framework that addresses the effectiveness of the technique patient outcomes and satisfaction and the cost benefit relationship

mining open answers in questionnaire data surveys are important tools for marketing and for managing customer relationships the answers to open ended questions in particular often contain valuable information and provide an important basis for business decisions the summaries that human analysts make of these open answers however tend to rely too much on intuition and so aren t satisfactorily reliable moreover because the web makes it so easy to take surveys and solicit comments companies are finding themselves inundated with data from questionnaires and other sources handling it all manually would be not only cumbersome but also costly thus devising a computer system that can automatically mine useful information from open answers has become an important issue we have developed a survey analysis system that works on these principles the system mines open answers through two statistical learning techniques rule learning which we call rule analysis and correspondence analysis
neural networks for web content filtering with the proliferation of harmful internet content such as pornography violence and hate messages effective content filtering systems are essential many web filtering systems are commercially available and potential users can download trial versions from the internet however the techniques these systems use are insufficiently accurate and do not adapt well to the ever changing web to solve this problem we propose using artificial neural networks to classify web pages during content filtering we focus on blocking pornography because it is among the most prolific and harmful web content however our general framework is adaptable for filtering other objectionable web material
designing human centered distributed information systems many computer systems are designed according to engineering and technology principles and are typically difficult to learn and use the fields of human computer interaction interface design and human factors have made significant contributions to ease of use and are primarily concerned with the interfaces between systems and users not with the structures that are often more fundamental for designing truly human centered systems the emerging paradigm of human centered computing hcc which has taken many forms offers a new look at system design hcc requires more than merely designing an artificial agent to supplement a human agent the dynamic interactions in a distributed system composed of human and artificial agents and the context in which the system is situated are indispensable factors while we have successfully applied our methodology in designing a prototype of a human centered intelligent flight surgeon console at nasa johnson space center this article presents a methodology for designing human centered computing systems using electronic medical records emr systems

process specialization defining specialization for state diagrams a precise definition of specialization and inheritance promises to be as useful in organizational process modeling as it is in object modeling it would help us better understand maintain reuse and generate process models however even though object oriented analysis and design methodologies take full advantage of the object specialization hierarchy the process specialization hierarchy is not supported in major process representations such as the state diagram data flow diagram and uml representations partly underlying this lack of support is an implicit assumption that we can always specialize a process by treating it as just another object we argue in this paper that this is not so straightforward as it might seem we argue that a process specific approach must be developed we propose such an approach in the form of a set of transformations which when applied to a process description always result in specialization we illustrate this approach by applying it to the state diagram representation and demonstrate that this approach to process specialization is not only theoretically possible but shows promise as a method for categorizing and analyzing processes we point out apparent inconsistencies between our notion of process specialization and existing work on object specialization but show that these inconsistencies are superficial and that the definition we provide is compatible with the traditional notion of specialization
organizational design information transfer and the acquisition of rent producing resources within the resource based view of the firm a dynamic story has emerged in which the knowledge accumulated over the history of a firm and embedded in organizational routines and structures influences the firm s ability to recognize the value of new resources and capabilities this paper explores the possibility of firms to select organizational designs that increase the likelihood that they will recognize and value rent producing resources and capabilities a computational model is developed to study the tension between an organization s desire to explore its environment for new capabilities and the organization s need to exploit existing capabilities support is provided for the proposition that integration both externally and internally is an important source of dynamic capability the model provides greater insight into the tradeoffs between these two forms of integration and suggests when one form may be preferred over another in particular evidence is provided that in uncertain environments the ability to explore possible alternatives is critical while in more certain environments the ability to transfer information internally is paramount

adaptive thinning for bivariate scattered data this paper studies adaptive thinning strategies for approximating a large set of scattered data by piecewise linear functions over triangulated subsets our strategies depend on both the locations of the data points in the plane and the values of the sampled function at these points adaptive thinning all our thinning strategies remove data points one by one so as to minimize an estimate of the error that results by the removal of a point from the current set of points this estimate is termed anticipated error the thinning process generates subsets of most significant points such that the piecewise linear interpolants over the delaunay triangulations of these subsets approximate progressively the function values sampled at the original scattered points and such that the approximation errors are small relative to the number of points in the subsets we design various methods for computing the anticipated error at reasonable cost and compare and test the performance of the methods it is proved that for data sampled from a convex function with the strategy of convex triangulation the actual error is minimized by minimizing the best performing measure of anticipated error it is also shown that for data sampled from certain quadratic polynomials adaptive thinning is equivalent to thinning which depends only on the locations of the data points nonadaptive thinning based on our numerical tests and comparisons two practical adaptive thinning algorithms are proposed for thinning large data sets one which is more accurate and another which is faster

the best circulant preconditioners for hermitian toeplitz systems ii the multiple zero case for pt i see siam j numer anal vol 38 p 876 896 circulant type preconditioners have been proposed previously for ill conditioned hermitian toeplitz systems that are generated by nonnegative continuous functions with a zero of even order the proposed circulant preconditioners can be constructed without requiring explicit knowledge of the generating functions it was shown that the spectra of the preconditioned matrices are uniformly bounded except for a fixed number of outliers and that all eigenvalues are uniformly bounded away from zero therefore the conjugate gradient method converges linearly when applied to solving the circulant preconditioned systems previously it was claimed that this result can be extended to the case where the generating functions have multiple zeros the main aim of this paper is to give a complete convergence proof of the method for this class of generating functions

product development using a 3d computer model to optimize the stability of the rocket tm powered wheelchair a three dimensional 3d lumped parameter model of a powered wheelchair was created to aid the development of the rocket prototype wheelchair and to help explore the effect of innovative design features on its stability the model was developed using simulation software specifically working model 3d the accuracy of the model was determined by comparing both its static stability angles and dynamic behavior as it passed down a 4 8 cm 1 9 road curb at a heading of 45 degrees with the performance of the actual wheelchair the model s predictions of the static stability angles in the forward rearward and lateral directions were within 9 3 7 1 and 3 8 of the measured values respectively the average absolute error in the predicted position of the wheelchair as it moved down the curb was 2 2 cm m 0 9 per 3 3 traveled the accuracy was limited by the inability to model soft bodies the inherent difficulties in modeling a statically indeterminate system and the computing time nevertheless it was found to be useful in investigating the effect of eight design alterations on the lateral stability of the wheelchair stability was quantified by determining the static lateral stability angles and the maximum height of a road curb over which the wheelchair could successfully drive on a diagonal heading the model predicted that the stability was more dependent on the configuration of the suspension system than on the dimensions and weight distribution of the wheelchair furthermore for the situations and design alterations studied predicted improvements in static stability were not correlated with improvements in dynamic stability

the impact of the product mix on the value of flexibility product mix flexibility is one of the major types of manufacturing flexibility referring to the ability to produce a broad range of products or variants with presumed low changeover costs the value of such a capability is important to establish for an industrial firm in order to ensure that the flexibility provided will be at the right level and used profitably rather than in excess of market requirements and consequently costly we use option pricing theory to analyse the impact of various product mix issues on the value of flexibility the real options model we use incorporates multiple products capacity constraints as well as set up costs the issues treated here include the number of products demand variability correlation between products and the relative demand distribution within the product mix thus we are interested in the nature of the input data to analyse its effect on the value of flexibility we also check the impact at different capacity levels the results suggest that the value of flexibility i increases with an increasing number of products ii decreases with increasing volatility of product demand iii decreases the more positively correlated the demand is and iv reduces for marginal capacity with increasing levels of capacity of these the impact of positively correlated demand seems to be a major issue however the joint impact of the number of products and demand correlation showed some non intuitive results

estimation of 3 d left ventricular deformation from medical images using biomechanical models the quantitative estimation of regional cardiac deformation from three dimensional 3 d image sequences has important clinical implications for the assessment of viability in the heart wall we present here a generic methodology for estimating soft tissue deformation which integrates image derived information with biomechanical models and apply it to the problem of cardiac deformation estimation the method is image modality independent the images are segmented interactively and then initial correspondence is established using a shape tracking approach a dense motion field is then estimated using a transversely isotropic linear elastic model which accounts for the muscle fiber directions in the left ventricle the dense motion field is in turn used to calculate the deformation of the heart wall in terms of strain in cardiac specific directions the strains obtained using this approach in open chest dogs before and after coronary occlusion exhibit a high correlation with strains produced in the same animals using implanted markers further they show good agreement with previously published results in the literature this proposed method provides quantitative regional 3 d estimates of heart deformation

statistical analysis of nonlinearly reconstructed near infrared tomographic images ii experimental interpretation for pt i see ibid vol 21 no 7 p 755 63 2002 image error analysis of a diffuse near infrared tomography nir system has been carried out on simulated data using a statistical approach described in pt i of this paper pogue et al 2002 the methodology is used here with experimental data acquired on phantoms with a prototype imaging system intended for characterizing breast tissue results show that imaging performance is not limited by random measurement error but rather by calibration issues the image error over the entire field of view is generally not minimized when an accurate homogeneous estimate of the phantom properties is available however local image error over a target region of interest roi is reduced the image reconstruction process which includes a levenberg marquardt style regularization provides good minimization of the objective function yet its reduction is not always correlated with an overall image error decrease minimization of the bias in an roi which contains localized changes in the optical properties can be achieved through five to nine iterations of the algorithm precalibration of the algorithm through statistical evaluation of phantom studies may provide a better measure of the image accuracy than that implied by minimization of the standard objective function
statistical analysis of nonlinearly reconstructed near infrared tomographic images i theory and simulations near infrared nir diffuse tomography is an emerging method for imaging the interior of tissues to quantify concentrations of hemoglobin and exogenous chromophores noninvasively in vivo it often exploits an optical diffusion model based image reconstruction algorithm to estimate spatial property values from measurements of the light flux at the surface of the tissue in this study mean squared error mse over the image is used to evaluate methods for regularizing the ill posed inverse image reconstruction problem in nir tomography estimates of image bias and image standard deviation were calculated based upon 100 repeated reconstructions of a test image with randomly distributed noise added to the light flux measurements it was observed that the bias error dominates at high regularization parameter values while variance dominates as the algorithm is allowed to approach the optimal solution this optimum does not necessarily correspond to the minimum projection error solution but typically requires further iteration with a decreasing regularization parameter to reach the lowest image error increasing measurement noise causes a need to constrain the minimum regularization parameter to higher values in order to achieve a minimum in the overall image mse
the use of visual search for knowledge gathering in image decision support this paper presents a new method of knowledge gathering for decision support in image understanding based on information extracted from the dynamics of saccadic eye movements the framework involves the construction of a generic image feature extraction library from which the feature extractors that are most relevant to the visual assessment by domain experts are determined automatically through factor analysis the dynamics of the visual search are analyzed by using the markov model for providing training information to novices on how and where to look for image features the validity of the framework has been evaluated in a clinical scenario whereby the pulmonary vascular distribution on computed tomography images was assessed by experienced radiologists as a potential indicator of heart failure the performance of the system has been demonstrated by training four novices to follow the visual assessment behavior of two experienced observers in all cases the accuracy of the students improved from near random decision making 33 to accuracies ranging from 50 to 68
quantitative analysis of reconstructed 3 d coronary arterial tree and intracoronary devices traditional quantitative coronary angiography is performed on two dimensional 2 d projection views these views are chosen by the angiographer to minimize vessel overlap and foreshortening with 2 d projection views that are acquired in this nonstandardized fashion however there is no way to know or estimate how much error occurs in the qca process furthermore coronary arteries possess a curvilinear shape and undergo a cyclical deformation due to their attachment to the myocardium therefore it is necessary to obtain three dimensional 3 d information to best describe and quantify the dynamic curvilinear nature of the human coronary artery using a patient specific 3 d coronary reconstruction algorithm and routine angiographic images a new technique is proposed to describe 1 the curvilinear nature of 3 d coronary arteries and intracoronary devices 2 the magnitude of the arterial deformation caused by intracoronary devices and due to heart motion and 3 optimal view s with respect to the desired pathway for delivering intracoronary devices

on a general constitutive description for the inelastic and failure behavior of fibrous laminates i lamina theory it is well known that a structural design with isotropic materials can only be accomplished based on a stress failure criterion this is however generally not true with laminated composites only when the laminate is subjected to an in plane load can the ultimate failure of the laminate correspond to its last ply failure and hence a stress failure criterion may be sufficient to detect the maximum load that can be sustained by the laminate even in such a case the load shared by each lamina in the laminate cannot be correctly determined if the lamina instantaneous stiffness matrix is inaccurately provided since the lamina is always statically indeterminate in the laminate if however the laminate is subjected to a lateral load its ultimate failure occurs before last ply failure and use of the stress failure criterion is no longer sufficient an additional critical deflection or curvature condition must also be employed this necessitates development of an efficient constitutive relationship for laminated composites in order that the laminate strains deflections up to ultimate failure can be accurately calculated a general constitutive description for the thermomechanical response of a fibrous laminate up to ultimate failure with applications to various fibrous laminates is presented in the two papers the constitutive relationship is obtained by combining classical lamination theory with a recently developed bridging micromechanics model through a layer by layer analysis this paper focuses on lamina analysis

well posed anisotropic diffusion for image denoising a nonlinear iterative smoothing filter based on a second order partial differential equation is introduced it smooths out the image according to an anisotropic diffusion process the approach is based on a smooth approximation of the total variation tv functional which overcomes the non differentiability of the tv functional at the origin in particular the authors perform linear smoothing over smooth areas but selective smoothing over candidate edges by relating the smoothing parameter to the time step they arrive at a cfl condition which guarantees the causality of the discrete scheme this allows the adoption of higher time discretisation steps while ensuring the absence of artefacts deriving from the non smooth behaviour of the tv functional at the origin in particular it is shown that the proposed approach avoids the typical staircase effects in smooth areas which occur in the standard time marching tv scheme

british standard 7666 as a framework for geocoding land and property information the uk the article examines the role of british standard 7666 in the development of a national framework for geocoding land and property information in the united kingdom the author assesses how local authorities and other agencies concerned with property and address datasets are coping with the introduction of british standard 7666 and examines the prospects and limitations of this development british standard 7666 has four parts comprising specifications for street gazetteer land and property gazetteer addresses and public rights of way the organisation coordinating the introduction of british standard 7666 improvement and development agency idea is also overseeing the development and maintenance of a national land and property gazetteer nlpg based on british standard 7666 the introduction of the new addressing standard has mainly been prompted by britain s effort to set up a national cadastral service to replace the obsolescent property registration system currently in place
a formal model of correctness in a cadastre a key issue for cadastral systems is the maintenance of their correctness correctness is defined to be the proper correspondence between the valid legal situation and the content of the cadastre this correspondence is generally difficult to achieve since the cadastre is not a complete representation of all aspects influencing the legal situation in reality the goal of the paper is to develop a formal model comprising representations of the cadastre and of reality that allows the simulation and investigation of cases where this correspondence is potentially violated for this purpose the model consists of two parts the first part represents the valid legal situation and the second part represents the cadastre this makes it feasible to mark the differences between reality and the cadastre the marking together with the two parts of the model facilitate the discussion of issues in real world cadastral systems where incorrectness occurs in order to develop a formal model the paper uses the transfer of ownership of a parcel between two persons as minimal case study the foundation for the formalization is a modern version of the situation calculus the focus moves from the analysis of the cadastre to the preparation of a conceptual and a formalized model and the implementation of a prototype

a review of methodologies used in research on cadastral development world wide much attention has been given to cadastral development as a consequence of experiences made during recent decades several authors have stated the need for research in the domain of cadastre and proposed methodologies to be used the paper contributes to the acceptance of research methodologies needed for cadastral development and thereby enhances theory in the cadastral domain the paper reviews nine publications on cadastre and identifies the methodologies used the review focuses on the institutional social political and economic aspects of cadastral development rather than on the technical aspects the main conclusion is that the methodologies used are largely those of the social sciences that agrees with the notion that cadastre relates as much to people and institutions as it relates to land and that cadastral systems are shaped by social political and economic conditions as well as technology since the geodetic survey profession has been the keeper of the cadastre geodetic surveyors will have to deal ever more with social science matters a fact that universities will have to consider
anticipating the further development of cadastral systems although the paper recognises the merits of the evolution of cadastral systems towards an increased capability over time it promotes a radical introduction or overhaul of existing cadastral systems it encourages the development of a capability to cope with some key drivers of major change these have been identified as globalisation the advent of fully automated cadastral environments improved decentralised methods of governance and greatly improved service delivery of future cadastral systems to a wide range of users the paper promotes the registration of title supported by government guarantee as an effective means for rapidly introducing cadastral systems to facilitate globally competitive land markets in developing countries in developing automated environments for cadastral systems the need to completely re engineer and redesign cadastral systems to meet basic cadastral principles and responsiveness to individual user needs is promoted in this environment highly decentralised cadastral operations and administration combined with light regulatory control are advocated as a future governance strategy with regard to the level of services to users an emphasis on recognising and serving the future needs of users is seen as essential international and national professional and user organisations involved in land administration are seen as an important vehicle for developing strategies and providing evaluation to guide the over arching development of cadastral systems around the world
the dynamic aspect of land administration an often forgotten component in system design although the establishment of a land administration system is enough of a challenge as it is the task of keeping the system up to date with developments in society is even more challenging initial adjudication and cadastral mapping basically record land tenure as it exists at a given moment i e the static situation the paper aims to analyse the developments that might occur in a society with respect to tenure value and use of land these developments constitute a dynamic component of land administration as land administration systems have to serve society on a long term basis and normally have a long term return on investment the author recommends taking into account both the static and dynamic component when designing land administration systems
on the expected value of the minimum assignment the minimum k assignment of an m n matrix x is the minimum sum of k entries of x no two of which belong to the same row or column coppersmith and sorkin conjectured that if x is generated by choosing each entry independently from the exponential distribution with mean 1 then the expected value of its minimum k assignment is given by an explicit formula which has been proven only in a few cases in this paper we describe our efforts to prove the coppersmith sorkin conjecture by considering the more general situation where the entries x sub ij of x are chosen independently from different distributions in particular we require that x sub ij be chosen from the exponential distribution with mean 1 r sub i c sub j we conjecture an explicit formula for the expected value of the minimum k assignment of such x and give evidence for this formula
too much middleware the movement from client server computing to multi tier computing has created a potpourri of so called middleware systems including application servers workflow products eai systems etl systems and federated data systems we argue that the explosion in middleware has created a myriad of poorly integrated systems with overlapping functionality the world would be well served by considerable consolidation and we present some of the ways this might happen some of the points covered in the article have been previously explored by p bernstein 1996
the xml typechecking problem when an xml document conforms to a given type e g a dtd or an xml schema type it is called a valid document checking if a given xml document is valid is called the validation problem and is typically performed by a parser hence validating parser more precisely it is performed right after parsing by the same program module in practice however xml documents are often generated dynamically by some program checking whether all xml documents generated by the program are valid wrt a given type is called the typechecking problem while a validation analyzes an xml document a type checker analyzes a program and the problem s difficulty is a function of the language in which that program is expressed the xml typechecking problem has been investigated recently and the xquery working group adopted some of these techniques for typechecking xquery all these techniques however have limitations which need to be understood and further explored and investigated we define the xml typechecking problem and present current approaches to typechecking discussing their limitations

semantic b2b integration issues in ontology based approaches solving queries to support e commerce transactions can involve retrieving and integrating information from multiple information resources often users don t care which resources are used to answer their query in such situations the ideal solution would be to hide from the user the details of the resources involved in solving a particular query an example would be providing seamless access to a set of heterogeneous electronic product catalogues there are many problems that must be addressed before such a solution can be provided in this paper we discuss a number of these problems indicate how we have addressed these and go on to describe the proof of concept demonstration system we have developed
conceptual modeling and specification generation for b2b business processes based on ebxml in order to support dynamic setup of business processes among independent organizations a formal standard schema for describing the business processes is basically required the ebxml framework provides such a specification schema called bpss business process specification schema which is available in two standalone representations a uml version and an xml version the former however is not intended for the direct creation of business process specifications but for defining specification elements and their relationships required for creating an ebxml compliant business process specification for this reason it is very important to support conceptual modeling that is well organized and directly matched with major modeling concepts this paper deals with how to represent and manage b2b business processes using uml compliant diagrams the major challenge is to organize uml diagrams in a natural way that is well suited to the business process meta model and then to transform the diagrams into an xml version this paper demonstrates the usefulness of conceptually modeling business processes by prototyping a business process editor tool called ebdesigner

negotiating the semantics of agent communication languages this article presents a formal framework and outlines a method that autonomous agents can use to negotiate the semantics of their communication language at run time such an ability is needed in open multi agent systems so that agents can ensure they understand the implications of the utterances that are being made and so that they can tailor the meaning of the primitives to best fit their prevailing circumstances to this end the semantic space framework provides a systematic means of classifying the primitives along multiple relevant dimensions this classification can then be used by the agents to structure their negotiation or semantic fixing process so that they converge to the mutually agreeable semantics that are necessary for coherent social interactions

to commit or not to commit modeling agent conversations for action conversations are sequences of messages exchanged among interacting agents for conversations to be meaningful agents ought to follow commonly known specifications limiting the types of messages that can be exchanged at any point in the conversation these specifications are usually implemented using conversation policies which are rules of inference or conversation protocols which are predefined conversation templates in this article we present a semantic model for specifying conversations using conversation policies this model is based on the principles that the negotiation and uptake of shared social commitments entail the adoption of obligations to action which indicate the actions that agents have agreed to perform in the same way obligations are retracted based on the negotiation to discharge their corresponding shared social commitments based on these principles conversations are specified as interaction specifications that model the ideal sequencing of agent participations negotiating the execution of actions in a joint activity these specifications not only specify the adoption and discharge of shared commitments and obligations during an activity but also indicate the commitments and obligations that are required as preconditions or that outlive a joint activity as postconditions we model the contract net protocol as an example of the specification of conversations in a joint activity

on the emergence of rules in neural networks a simple associationist neural network learns to factor abstract rules i e grammars from sequences of arbitrary input symbols by inventing abstract representations that accommodate unseen symbol sets as well as unseen but similar grammars the neural network is shown to have the ability to transfer grammatical knowledge to both new symbol vocabularies and new grammars analysis of the state space shows that the network learns generalized abstract structures of the input and is not simply memorizing the input strings these representations are context sensitive hierarchical and based on the state variable of the finite state machines that the neural network has learned generalization to new symbol sets or grammars arises from the spatial nature of the internal representations used by the network allowing new symbol sets to be encoded close to symbol sets that have already been learned in the hidden unit space of the network the results are counter to the arguments that learning algorithms based on weight adaptation after each exemplar presentation such as the long term potentiation found in the mammalian nervous system cannot in principle extract symbolic knowledge from positive examples as prescribed by prevailing human linguistic theory and evolutionary psychology

online auctions dynamic pricing and the lodging industry the traditional channels of distribution for overnight accommodation are rapidly being displaced by web site scripting online intermediaries and specialty brokers businesses that pioneered internet usage relied on it as a sales and marketing alternative to predecessor product distribution channels as such web sites replace the traditional trading model to the internet web enabled companies are popular because the medium renders the process faster less costly highly reliable and secure auction based models impact business models by converting the price setting mechanism from supplier centric to market centric and transforming the trading model from one to many to many to many historically pricing was based on the cost of production plus a margin of profit traditionally as products and services move through the supply chain from the producer to the consumer various intermediaries added their share of profit to the price as internet based mediums of distribution become more prevalent traditional pricing models are being supplanted with dynamic pricing a dynamic pricing model represents a flexible system that changes prices not only from product to product but also from customer to customer and transaction to transaction many industry leaders are skeptical of the long run impact of online auctions on lodging industry profit margins despite the fact pricing theory suggests that an increase in the flow of information results in efficient market pricing the future of such endeavors remains promising but controversial

efficient computation of local geometric moments local moments have attracted attention as local features in applications such as edge detection and texture segmentation the main reason for this is that they are inherently integral based features so that their use reduces the effect of uncorrelated noise the computation of local moments when viewed as a neighborhood operation can be interpreted as a convolution of the image with a set of masks nevertheless moments computed inside overlapping windows are not independent and convolution does not take this fact into account by introducing a matrix formulation and the concept of accumulation moments this paper presents an algorithm which is computationally much more efficient than convolving and yet as simple
adaptive image denoising using scale and space consistency this paper proposes a new method for image denoising with edge preservation based on image multiresolution decomposition by a redundant wavelet transform in our approach edges are implicitly located and preserved in the wavelet domain whilst image noise is filtered out at each resolution level the image edges are estimated by gradient magnitudes obtained from the wavelet coefficients which are modeled probabilistically and a shrinkage function is assembled based on the model obtained joint use of space and scale consistency is applied for better preservation of edges the shrinkage functions are combined to preserve edges that appear simultaneously at several resolutions and geometric constraints are applied to preserve edges that are not isolated the proposed technique produces a filtered version of the original image where homogeneous regions appear separated by well defined edges possible applications include image presegmentation and image denoising
tracking nonparameterized object contours in video we propose a new method for contour tracking in video the inverted distance transform of the edge map is used as an edge indicator function for contour detection using the concept of topographical distance the watershed segmentation can be formulated as a minimization this new viewpoint gives a way to combine the results of the watershed algorithm on different surfaces in particular our algorithm determines the contour as a combination of the current edge map and the contour predicted from the tracking result in the previous frame we also show that the problem of background clutter can be relaxed by taking the object motion into account the compensation with object motion allows to detect and remove spurious edges in background the experimental results confirm the expected advantages of the proposed method over the existing approaches
multilayered image representation application to image compression the main contribution of this work is a new paradigm for image representation and image compression we describe a new multilayered representation technique for images an image is parsed into a superposition of coherent layers piecewise smooth regions layer textures layer etc the multilayered decomposition algorithm consists in a cascade of compressions applied successively to the image itself and to the residuals that resulted from the previous compressions during each iteration of the algorithm we code the residual part in a lossy way we only retain the most significant structures of the residual part which results in a sparse representation each layer is encoded independently with a different transform or basis at a different bitrate and the combination of the compressed layers can always be reconstructed in a meaningful way the strength of the multilayer approach comes from the fact that different sets of basis functions complement each others some of the basis functions will give reasonable account of the large trend of the data while others will catch the local transients or the oscillatory patterns this multilayered representation has a lot of beautiful applications in image understanding and image and video coding we have implemented the algorithm and we have studied its capabilities
combining spatial and scale space techniques for edge detection to provide a spatially adaptive wavelet based noise filtering algorithm new methods for detecting edges in an image using spatial and scale space domains are proposed a priori knowledge about geometrical characteristics of edges is used to assign a probability factor to the chance of any pixel being on an edge an improved double thresholding technique is introduced for spatial domain filtering probabilities that pixels belong to a given edge are assigned based on pixel similarity across gradient amplitudes gradient phases and edge connectivity the scale space approach uses dynamic range compression to allow wavelet correlation over a wider range of scales a probabilistic formulation is used to combine the results obtained from filtering in each domain to provide a final edge probability image which has the advantages of both spatial and scale space domain methods decomposing this edge probability image with the same wavelet as the original image permits the generation of adaptive filters that can recognize the characteristics of the edges in all wavelet detail and approximation images regardless of scale these matched filters permit significant reduction in image noise without contributing to edge distortion the spatially adaptive wavelet noise filtering algorithm is qualitatively and quantitatively compared to a frequency domain and two wavelet based noise suppression algorithms using both natural and computer generated noisy images

on optimality in auditory information processing we study limits for the detection and estimation of weak sinusoidal signals in the primary part of the mammalian auditory system using a stochastic fitzhugh nagumo model and an action recovery model for synaptic depression our overall model covers the chain from a hair cell to a point just after the synaptic connection with a cell in the cochlear nucleus the information processing performance of the system is evaluated using so called phi divergences from statistics that quantify dissimilarity between probability measures and are intimately related to a number of fundamental limits in statistics and information theory it we show that there exists a set of parameters that can optimize several important phi divergences simultaneously and that this set corresponds to a constant quiescent firing rate qfr of the spiral ganglion neuron the optimal value of the qfr is frequency dependent but is essentially independent of the amplitude of the signal for small amplitudes consequently optimal processing according to several standard it criteria can be accomplished for this model if and only if the parameters are tuned to values that correspond to one and the same qfr this offers a new explanation for the qfr and can provide new insight into the role played by several other parameters of the peripheral auditory system

preintegration lateral inhibition enhances unsupervised learning a large and influential class of neural network architectures uses postintegration lateral inhibition as a mechanism for competition we argue that these algorithms are computationally deficient in that they fail to generate or learn appropriate perceptual representations under certain circumstances an alternative neural network architecture is presented here in which nodes compete for the right to receive inputs rather than for the right to generate outputs this form of competition implemented through preintegration lateral inhibition does provide appropriate coding properties and can be used to learn such representations efficiently furthermore this architecture is consistent with both neuroanatomical and neuropsychological data we thus argue that preintegration lateral inhibition has computational advantages over conventional neural network architectures while remaining equally biologically plausible

adaptive filtering for noise reduction in hue saturation intensity color space even though the hue saturation intensity hsi color model has been widely used in color image processing and analysis the conversion formulas from the rgb color model to hsi are nonlinear and complicated in comparison with the conversion formulas of other color models when an rgb image is degraded by random gaussian noise this nonlinearity leads to a nonuniform noise distribution in hsi making accurate image analysis more difficult we have analyzed the noise characteristics of the hsi color model and developed an adaptive spatial filtering method to reduce the magnitude of noise and the nonuniformity of noise variance in the hsi color space with this adaptive filtering method the filter kernel for each pixel is dynamically adjusted depending on the values of intensity and saturation in our experiments we have filtered the saturation and hue components and generated edge maps from color gradients we have found that by using the adaptive filtering method the minimum error rate in edge detection improves by approximately 15

effective moving cast shadow detection for monocular color traffic image sequences for an accurate scene analysis using monocular color traffic image sequences a robust segmentation of moving vehicles from the stationary background is generally required however the presence of moving cast shadow may lead to an inaccurate vehicle segmentation and as a result may lead to further erroneous scene analysis we propose an effective method for the detection of moving cast shadow by observing the characteristics of cast shadow in the luminance chrominance gradient density and geometry domains a combined probability map called a shadow confidence score scs is obtained from the edge map of the input image each edge pixel is examined to determine whether it belongs to the vehicle region based on its neighboring scss the cast shadow is identified as those regions with high scss which are outside the convex hull of the selected vehicle edge pixels the proposed method is tested on 100 vehicle images taken under different lighting conditions sunny and cloudy viewing angles roadside and overhead vehicle sizes small medium and large and colors similar to the road and not the results indicate that an average error rate of around 14 is obtained while the lowest error rate is around 3 for large vehicles
estimation of error in curvature computation on multi scale free form surfaces a novel technique for multi scale curvature computation on a free form 3 d surface is presented this is achieved by convolving local parametrisations of the surface with 2 d gaussian filters iteratively in our technique semigeodesic coordinates are constructed at each vertex of the mesh smoothing results are shown for 3 d surfaces with different shapes indicating that surface noise is eliminated and surface details are removed gradually a number of evolution properties of 3 d surfaces are described next the surface gaussian and mean curvature values are estimated accurately at multiple scales which are then mapped to colours and displayed directly on the surface the performance of the technique when selecting different directions as an arbitrary direction for the geodesic at each vertex are also presented the results indicate that the error observed for the estimation of gaussian and mean curvatures is quite low after only one iteration furthermore as the surface is smoothed iteratively the error is further reduced the results also show that the estimation error of gaussian curvature is less than that of mean curvature our experiments demonstrate that estimation of smoothed surface curvatures are very accurate and not affected by the arbitrary direction of the first geodesic line when constructing semigeodesic coordinates our technique is independent of the underlying triangulation and is also more efficient than volumetric diffusion techniques since 2 d rather than 3 d convolutions are employed finally the method presented here is a generalisation of the curvature scale space method for 2 d contours the css method has outperformed comparable techniques within the mpeg 7 evaluation framework as a result it has been selected for inclusion in the mpeg 7 package of standards

plenoptic image editing this paper presents a new class of interactive image editing operations designed to maintain consistency between multiple images of a physical 3d scene the distinguishing feature of these operations is that edits to any one image propagate automatically to all other images as if the unknown 3d scene had itself been modified the modified scene can then be viewed interactively from any other camera viewpoint and under different scene illuminations the approach is useful first as a power assist that enables a user to quickly modify many images by editing just a few and second as a means for constructing and editing image based scene representations by manipulating a set of photographs the approach works by extending operations like image painting scissoring and morphing so that they alter a scene s plenoptic function in a physically consistent way thereby affecting scene appearance from all viewpoints simultaneously a key element in realizing these operations is a new volumetric decomposition technique for reconstructing an scene s plenoptic function from an incomplete set of camera viewpoints

choice from a three element set some lessons of the 2000 presidential campaign in the united states we consider the behavior of four choice rules plurality voting approval voting borda count and self consistent choice when applied to choose the best option from a three element set it is assumed that the two main options are preferred by a large majority of the voters while the third option gets a very small number of votes and influences the election outcome only when the two main options receive a close number of votes when used to rate the main options borda count and self consistent choice contain terms that allow both for the strength of preferences of the voters and the rating of the main candidates by voters who vote for the third option in this way it becomes possible to determine more reliably the winner when plurality voting or approval voting produce close results

self calibration from image derivatives this study investigates the problem of estimating camera calibration parameters from image motion fields induced by a rigidly moving camera with unknown parameters where the image formation is modeled with a linear pinhole camera model the equations obtained show the flow to be separated into a component due to the translation and the calibration parameters and a component due to the rotation and the calibration parameters a set of parameters encoding the latter component is linearly related to the flow and from these parameters the calibration can be determined however as for discrete motion in general it is not possible to decouple image measurements obtained from only two frames into translational and rotational components geometrically the ambiguity takes the form of a part of the rotational component being parallel to the translational component and thus the scene can be reconstructed only up to a projective transformation in general for full calibration at least four successive image frames are necessary with the 3d rotation changing between the measurements the geometric analysis gives rise to a direct self calibration method that avoids computation of optical flow or point correspondences and uses only normal flow measurements new constraints on the smoothness of the surfaces in view are formulated to relate structure and motion directly to image derivatives and on the basis of these constraints the transformation of the viewing geometry between consecutive images is estimated the calibration parameters are then estimated from the rotational components of several flow fields as the proposed technique neither requires a special set up nor needs exact correspondence it is potentially useful for the calibration of active vision systems which have to acquire knowledge about their intrinsic parameters while they perform other tasks or as a tool for analyzing image sequences in large video databases

teaching modeling in management science this essay discusses how we can most effectively teach management science to students in mba or similar programs who will be at best part time practitioners of these arts i take as a working hypothesis the radical proposition that the heart of management science itself is not the impressive array of tools that have been built up over the years optimization simulation decision analysis queuing and so on but rather the art of reasoning logically with formal models i believe it is necessary with this group of students to teach basic modeling skills and in fact it is only when such students have these basic skills as a foundation that they are prepared to acquire the more sophisticated skills needed to employ management science in this paper i present a hierarchy of modeling skills from numeracy skills through sophisticated management science skills as a framework within which to plan courses for the occasional practitioner
causes of the decline of the business school management science course the business school management science course is suffering serious decline the traditional model and algorithm based course fails to meet the needs of mba programs and students poor student mathematical preparation is a reality and is not an acceptable justification for poor teaching outcomes management science ph d s are often poorly prepared to teach in a general management program having more experience and interest in algorithms than management the management science profession as a whole has focused its attention on algorithms and a narrow subset of management problems for which they are most applicable in contrast mba s rarely encounter problems that are suitable for straightforward application of management science tools living instead in a world where problems are ill defined data is scarce time is short politics is dominant and rational decision makers are non existent the root cause of the profession s failure to address these issues seems to be in russell ackoff s words a habit of professional introversion that caused the profession to be uninterested in what mba s really do on the job and how management science can help them
gifts to a science academic librarian gifts by their altruistic nature perfectly fit into the environment of universities and academic libraries as a university s community and general public continue to donate materials libraries accept donations willingly both in kind and monetary eight steps of gift processing are listed in the paper positive and negative aspects of gift acceptance are discussed gifts bring value for academic libraries gifts can be considered additional routes to contribute to library collections without direct purchases options to add money to the library budget and the cement of social relationships but unfortunately large donations are time consuming labor intensive and costly to process great amounts of staff time and processing space are two main negative aspects that cause concern and put the value of gift acceptance under consideration by librarians some strategies in handling gifts are recommended to be effective academic science librarians need to approach gifts as an investment librarians are not to be forced by moral and public notions and should be able to make professional decisions in evaluating proposed collections

information architecture looking ahead it may be a bit strange to consider where the field of information architecture ia is headed after all many would argue that it s too new to be considered as a field at all or that it is mislabeled and by no means is there a widely accepted definition of what information architecture actually is practicing information architects probably number in the thousands and this vibrant group is already building various forms of communal infrastructure ranging from an ia journal and a self organizing library of resources to a passel of local professional groups and degree granting academic programs so the profession has achieved a beachhead that will enable it to stabilize and perhaps even grow during these difficult times

the effects of emotions on bounded rationality a comment on kaufman bruce kaufman s article 1999 emotional arousal as a source of bounded rationality objective is to present an additional source of bounded rationality one that is not due to cognitive constraints but to high emotional arousal in doing so kaufman is following a long tradition of thinkers who have contrasted emotion with reason claiming for the most part that emotions are a violent force hindering rational thinking this paper aims to challenge kaufman s unidimensional idea regarding the connection between high emotional arousal and decision making
emotion and self control a biology based model of choice is used to examine time inconsistent preferences and the problem of self control emotion is shown to be the biological substrate of choice in that emotional systems assign value to goods in the environment and also facilitate the learning of expectations regarding alternative options for acquiring those goods a third major function of the emotional choice systems is motivation self control is shown to be the result of a problem with the inhibition of the motive force of emotion where this inhibition is necessary for higher level deliberation

a comparison of the discounted utility model and hyperbolic discounting models in the case of social and private intertemporal preferences for health whilst there is substantial evidence that hyperbolic discounting models describe intertemporal preferences for monetary outcomes better than the discounted utility du model there is only very limited evidence in the context of health outcomes this study elicits private and social intertemporal preferences for non fatal changes in health specific functional forms of the du model and three hyperbolic models are fitted the results show that the stationarity axiom is violated and that the hyperbolic models fit the data better than the du model intertemporal preferences for private and social decisions are found to be very similar
modeling the labor market as an evolving institution model artemis a stylized french labor market is modeled as an endogenously evolving institution boundedly rational firms and individuals strive to decrease the cost or increase utility the labor market is coordinated by a search process and decentralized setting of hiring standards but intermediaries can speed up matching the model reproduces the dynamics of the gross flows and spectacular changes in mobility patterns of some demographic groups when the oil crisis in the 1970 s occurred notably the sudden decline of the integration in good jobs the internal labor markets of large firms are shown to increase unemployment if the secondary temporary or bad jobs do not exist
the ultimate control group empirical research on the organization of firms requires that firms be classified on the basis of their control structures this should be done in a way that can potentially be made operational it is easy to identify the ultimate controller of a hierarchical organization and the literature has largely focused on this case however many organizational structures mix hierarchy with collective choice procedures such as voting or use circular structures under which superiors are accountable to their subordinates the author develops some analytic machinery that can be used to map the authority structures of such organizations and show that under mild restrictions there is a well defined ultimate control group the results are consistent with intuitions about the nature of control in familiar economic settings

prospects for quantitative computed tomography imaging in the presence of foreign metal bodies using statistical image reconstruction x ray computed tomography ct images of patients bearing metal intracavitary applicators or other metal foreign objects exhibit severe artifacts including streaks and aliasing we have systematically evaluated via computer simulations the impact of scattered radiation the polyenergetic spectrum and measurement noise on the performance of three reconstruction algorithms conventional filtered backprojection fbp deterministic iterative deblurring and a new iterative algorithm alternating minimization am based on a ct detector model that includes noise scatter and polyenergetic spectra contrary to the dominant view of the literature fbp streaking artifacts are due mostly to mismatches between fbp s simplified model of ct detector response and the physical process of signal acquisition artifacts on am images are significantly mitigated as this algorithm substantially reduces detector model mismatches however metal artifacts are reduced to acceptable levels only when prior knowledge of the metal object in the patient including its pose shape and attenuation map are used to constrain am s iterations am image reconstruction in combination with object constrained ct to estimate the pose of metal objects in the patient is a promising approach for effectively mitigating metal artifacts and making quantitative estimation of tissue attenuation coefficients a clinical possibility
matching pet and ct scans of the head and neck area development of method and validation positron emission tomography pet provides important information on tumor biology but lacks detailed anatomical information our aim in the present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration method for matching pet and ct scans of the head and neck three difficulties in achieving this goal are 1 nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations 2 emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods and 3 no objective way exists to quantify the quality of the match results these problems are solved as follows accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask the proposed method makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan to obtain sufficient anatomical information for matching two bed positions for the transmission scan were included in the protocol a mutual information based algorithm was used as a registration technique pet and ct data were obtained in seven patients each patient had two ct scans and one pet scan the datasets were used to estimate the consistency by matching pet to ct sub 1 ct sub 1 to ct sub 2 and ct sub 2 to pet using the full circle consistency test it was found that using our method consistency could be obtained of 4 mm and 1 3 degrees on average the pet voxels used for registration were 5 15 mm so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size cropping the images removing the scanner bed from images did not improve the consistency of the algorithm the transmission scan however could potentially be reduced to a single position using this approach in conclusion the represented algorithm and validation technique has several features that are attractive from both theoretical and practical point of view it is a user independent automatic validation technique for matching ct and pet scans of the head and neck which gives the opportunity to compare different image enhancements

global stability of the attracting set of an enzyme catalysed reaction system the essential feature of enzymatic reactions is a nonlinear dependency of reaction rate on metabolite concentration taking the form of saturation kinetics recently it has been shown that this feature is associated with the phenomenon of loss of system coordination liu 1999 in this paper we study a system of ordinary differential equations representing a branched biochemical system of enzyme mediated reactions we show that this system can become very sensitive to changes in certain maximum enzyme activities in particular we show that the system exhibits three distinct responses a unique globally stable steady state large amplitude oscillations and asymptotically unbounded solutions with the transition between these states being almost instantaneous it is shown that the appearance of large amplitude stable limit cycles occurs due to a false bifurcation or canard explosion the subsequent disappearance of limit cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in the flow namely a saddle connection subsequently almost all nonnegative data become unbounded under the action of the dynamical system and correspond exactly to loss of system coordination we discuss the relevance of these results to the possible consequences of modulating such systems
a spatial rainfall simulator for crop production modeling in southern africa this paper describes a methodology for simulating rainfall in dekads across a set of spatial units in areas where long term meteorological records are available for a small number of sites only the work forms part of a larger simulation model of the food system in a district of zimbabwe which includes a crop production component for yields of maize small grains and groundnuts only a limited number of meteorological stations are available within or surrounding the district that have long time series of rainfall records preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intra seasonal temporal correlation was negligible but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations this spatial correlation structure can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of 30 related variables representing dekadly rainfall in each of the 30 wards for each ward log transformed rainfall for each of the 36 dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations a covariance matrix derived from a distance measure was then used to represent the spatial correlation between wards sets of random numbers were then drawn from this distribution to simulate rainfall across the wards in any given dekad cross validation of estimated rainfall parameters against observed parameters for the one meteorological station within the district suggests that the interpolation process works well the methodology developed is useful in situations where long term climatic records are scarce and where rainfall shows pronounced spatial correlation but negligible temporal correlation

discrete output feedback sliding mode control of second order systems a moving switching line approach the sliding mode control systems smcs for which the switching variable is designed independent of the initial conditions are known to be sensitive to parameter variations and extraneous disturbances during the reaching phase for second order systems this drawback is eliminated by using the moving switching line technique where the switching line is initially designed to pass the initial conditions and is subsequently moved towards a predetermined switching line in this paper we make use of the above idea of moving switching line together with the reaching law approach to design a discrete output feedback sliding mode control the main contributions of this work are such that we do not require to use system states as it makes use of only the output samples for designing the controller and by using the moving switching line a low sensitivity system is obtained through shortening the reaching phase simulation results show that the fast output sampling feedback guarantees sliding motion similar to that obtained using state feedback
when a better interface and easy navigation aren t enough examining the information architecture in a law enforcement agency an information architecture that allows users to easily navigate through a system and quickly recover from mistakes is often defined as a highly usable system but usability in systems design goes beyond a good interface and efficient navigation in this article we describe two database systems in a law enforcement agency one system is a legacy text based system with cumbersome navigation rms the newer system is a graphical user interface with simplified navigation copnet it is hypothesized that law enforcement users will evaluate copnet higher than rms but experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than others will we conducted two user studies one study examined what users thought of rms and copnet and compared rms experts evaluations with nonexperts we found that all users evaluated copnet as more effective easier to use and easier to navigate than rms and this was especially noticeable for users who were not experts with the older system the second follow up study examined use behavior after copnet was deployed some time later the findings revealed that evaluations of copnet were not associated with its use if the newer system had a better interface and was easier to navigate than the older legacy system why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch we discuss reasons why switching to a new system is difficult especially for those who are most adept at using the older system implications for system design and usability are also discussed

collective action in the age of the internet mass communication and online mobilization this article examines how the internet transforms collective action current practices on the web bear witness to thriving collective action ranging from persuasive to confrontational individual to collective undertakings even more influential than direct calls for action is the indirect mobilizing influence of the internet s powers of mass communication which is boosted by an antiauthoritarian ideology on the web theoretically collective action through the otherwise socially isolating computer is possible because people rely on internalized group memberships and social identities to achieve social involvement empirical evidence from an online survey among environmental activists and nonactivists confirms that online action is considered an equivalent alternative to offline action by activists and nonactivists alike however the internet may slightly alter the motives underlying collective action and thereby alter the nature of collective action and social movements perhaps more fundamental is the reverse influence that successful collective action will have on the nature and function of the internet
explanations for the perpetration of and reactions to deception in a virtual community cases of identity deception on the internet are not uncommon several cases of a revealed identity deception have been reported in the media the authors examine a case of deception in an online community composed primarily of information technology professionals in this case an established community member df invented a character nowheremom whom he fell in love with and who was eventually killed in a tragic accident when other members of the community eventually began to question nowheremom s actual identity df admitted that he invented her the discussion board was flooded with reactions to df s revelation the authors propose several explanations for the perpetration of identity deception including psychiatric illness identity play and expressions of true self they also analyze the reactions of community members and propose three related explanations social identity deviance and norm violation to account for their reactions it is argued that virtual communities reactions to such threatening events provide invaluable clues for the study of group processes on the internet
the effects of asynchronous computer mediated group interaction on group processes this article reports a study undertaken to investigate some of the social psychological processes underlying computer supported group discussion in natural computer mediated contexts based on the concept of deindividuation it was hypothesized that personal identifiability and group identity would be important factors that affect the perceptions and behavior of members of computer mediated groups the degree of personal identifiability and the strength of group identity were manipulated across groups of geographically dispersed computer users who took part in e mail discussions during a 2 week period the results do not support the association between deindividuation and uninhibited behavior cited in much previous research instead the data provide some support for a social identity perspective of computer mediated communication which explains the higher levels uninhibited in identifiable computer mediated groups however predictions based on social identity theory regarding group polarization and group cohesion were not supported possible explanations for this are discussed and further research is suggested to resolve these discrepancies

support vector machines model for classification of thermal error in machine tools this paper addresses a change in the concept of machine tool thermal error prediction which has been hitherto carried out by directly mapping them with the temperature of critical elements on the machine the model developed herein using support vector machines a powerful data training algorithm seeks to account for the impact of specific operating conditions in addition to temperature variation on the effective prediction of thermal errors several experiments were conducted to study the error pattern which was found to change significantly with variation in operating conditions this model attempts to classify the error based on operating conditions once classified the error is then predicted based on the temperature states this paper also briefly describes the concept of the implementation of such a comprehensive model along with an on line error assessment and calibration system in a pc based open architecture controller environment so that it could be employed in regular production for the purpose of periodic calibration of machine tools
adaptive and efficient mutual exclusion the paper presents adaptive algorithms for mutual exclusion using only read and write operations the performance of the algorithms depends only on the point contention i e the number of processes that are concurrently active during algorithm execution and not on n the total number of processes our algorithm has o k remote step complexity and o log k system response time where k is the point contention the remote step complexity is the maximal number of steps performed by a process where a wait is counted as one step the system response time is the time interval between subsequent entries to the critical section where one time unit is the minimal interval in which every active process performs at least one step the space complexity of this algorithm is o n log n where n is the range of process names we show how to make the space complexity of our algorithm depend solely on n while preserving the other performance measures of the algorithm
the congenial talking philosophers problem in computer networks group mutual exclusion occurs naturally in situations where a resource can be shared by processes of the same group but not by processes of different groups for example suppose data is stored in a cd jukebox then when a disc is loaded for access users that need data on the disc can concurrently access the disc while users that need data on a different disc have to wait until the current disc is unloaded the design issues for group mutual exclusion have been modeled as the congenial talking philosophers problem and solutions for shared memory models have been proposed y j young 2000 p keane and m moir 1999 as in ordinary mutual exclusion and many other problems in distributed systems however techniques developed for shared memory do not necessarily apply to message passing and vice versa we investigate solutions for congenial talking philosophers in computer networks where processes communicate by asynchronous message passing we first present a solution that is a straightforward adaptation from g ricart and a k agrawala s 1981 algorithm for ordinary mutual exclusion then we show that the simple modification suffers a severe performance degradation that could cause the system to behave as though only one process of a group can be in the critical section at a time we then present a more efficient and highly concurrent distributed algorithm for the problem the first such solution in computer networks
universal dynamic synchronous self stabilization we prove the existence of a universal synchronous self stabilizing protocol that is a protocol that allows a distributed system to stabilize to a desired nonreactive behaviour as long as a protocol stabilizing to that behaviour exists previous proposals required drastic increases in asymmetry and knowledge to work whereas our protocol does not use any additional knowledge and does not require more symmetry breaking conditions than available thus it is also stabilizing with respect to dynamic changes in the topology we prove an optimal quiescence time n d for a synchronous network of n processors and diameter d the protocol can be made finite state with a negligible loss in quiescence time moreover an optimal d 1 protocol is given for the case of unique identifiers as a consequence we provide an effective proof technique that allows one to show whether self stabilization to a certain behaviour is possible under a wide range of models

identification of evolving fuzzy rule based models an approach to identification of evolving fuzzy rule based er models is proposed er models implement a method for the noniterative update of both the rule base structure and parameters by incremental unsupervised learning the rule base evolves by adding more informative rules than those that previously formed the model in addition existing rules can be replaced with new rules based on ranking using the informative potential of the data in this way the rule base structure is inherited and updated when new informative data become available rather than being completely retrained the adaptive nature of these evolving rule based models in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules makes them a promising candidate for modeling and control of complex processes competitive to neural networks the approach has been tested on a benchmark problem and on an air conditioning component modeling application using data from an installation serving a real building the results illustrate the viability and efficiency of the approach

building digital collections at the oac current strategies with a view to future uses providing a context for the exploration of user defined virtual collections the article describes the history and recent development of the online archive of california oac stating that usability and user needs are primary factors in digital resource development issues explored include collaborations to build digital collections reliance upon professional standards for description and encoding system architecture interface design the need for user tools and the role of archivists as interpreters in the digital environment
nuts and bolts implementing descriptive standards to enable virtual collections to date online archival information systems have relied heavily on legacy finding aids for data to encode and provide to end users despite fairly strong indications in the archival literature that such legacy data is problematic even as a mediated access tool archivists have only just begun to study the utility of archival descriptive data for end users in unmediated settings such as via the web the ability of future archival information systems to respond to the expectations and needs of end users is inextricably linked to archivists getting their collective data house in order the general international standard archival description isad g offers the profession a place from which to start extricating ourselves from the idiosyncracies of our legacy data and description practices

the archival imagination of david bearman revisited many archivists regard the archival imagination evidenced in the writings of david bearman as avant garde archivist l henry 1998 has sharply criticized bearman for being irreverent toward the archival theory and practice outlined by classical american archivist t r schellenberg although bearman is sometimes credited and sometimes berated for establishing a new paradigm centered on the archival management of electronic records his methods and strategies are intended to encompass all forms of record keeping the article provides general observations on bearman s archival imagination lists some of its components and addresses elements of henry s critique although the long lasting impact of bearman s imagination upon the archival profession might be questioned it nonetheless deserves continued consideration by archivists and inclusion as a component of graduate archival education
pattern recognition strategies for molecular surfaces ii surface complementarity for pt i see ibid vol 23 p 1176 87 2002 fuzzy logic based algorithms for the quantitative treatment of complementarity of molecular surfaces are presented therein the overlapping surface patches defined in part i of this series are used the identification of complementary surface patches can be considered as a first step for the solution of molecular docking problems standard technologies can then be used for further optimization of the resulting complex structures the algorithms are applied to 33 biomolecular complexes after the optimization with a downhill simplex method for all these complexes one structure was found which is in very good agreement with the experimental results
pattern recognition strategies for molecular surfaces i pattern generation using fuzzy set theory a new method for the characterization of molecules based on the model approach of molecular surfaces is presented we use the topographical properties of the surface as well as the electrostatic potential the local lipophilicity hydrophilicity and the hydrogen bond density on the surface for characterization the definition and the calculation method for these properties are reviewed the surface is segmented into overlapping patches with similar molecular properties these patches can be used to represent the characteristic local features of the molecule in a way that is beyond the atomistic resolution but can nevertheless be applied for the analysis of partial similarities of different molecules as well as for the identification of molecular complementarity in a very general sense the patch representation can be used for different applications which will be demonstrated in subsequent articles

genetic algorithm guided selection variable selection and subset selection a novel genetic algorithm guided selection method gas has been described the method utilizes a simple encoding scheme which can represent both compounds and variables used to construct a qsar qspr model a genetic algorithm is then utilized to simultaneously optimize the encoded variables that include both descriptors and compound subsets the gas method generates multiple models each applying to a subset of the compounds typically the subsets represent clusters with different chemotypes also a procedure based on molecular similarity is presented to determine which model should be applied to a given test set compound the variable selection method implemented in gas has been tested and compared using the selwood data set n 31 compounds nu 53 descriptors the results showed that the method is comparable to other published methods the subset selection method implemented in gas has been first tested using an artificial data set n 100 points nu 1 descriptor to examine its ability to subset data points and second applied to analyze the xlogp data set n 1831 compounds nu 126 descriptors the method is able to correctly identify artificial data points belonging to various subsets the analysis of the xlogp data set shows that the subset selection method can be useful in improving a qsar qspr model when the variable selection method fails
a formal model of computing with words classical automata are formal models of computing with values fuzzy automata are generalizations of classical automata where the knowledge about the system s next state is vague or uncertain it is worth noting that like classical automata fuzzy automata can only process strings of input symbols therefore such fuzzy automata are still abstract devices for computing with values although a certain vagueness or uncertainty are involved in the process of computation we introduce a new kind of fuzzy automata whose inputs are instead strings of fuzzy subsets of the input alphabet these new fuzzy automata may serve as formal models of computing with words we establish an extension principle from computing with values to computing with words this principle indicates that computing with words can be implemented with computing with values with the price of a big amount of extra computations
using molecular equivalence numbers to visually explore structural features that distinguish chemical libraries a molecular equivalence number meqnum classifies a molecule with respect to a class of structural features or topological shapes such as its cyclic system or its set of functional groups meqnums can be used to organize molecular structures into nonoverlapping yet highly relatable classes we illustrate the construction of some different types of meqnums and present via examples some methods of comparing diverse chemical libraries based on meqnums in the examples we compare a library which is a random sample from the mdl drug data report mddr with a library which is a random sample from the available chemical directory acd in our analyses we discover some interesting features of the topological shape of a molecule and its set of functional groups that are strongly linked with compounds occurring in the mddr but not in the acd we also illustrate the utility of molecular equivalence indices in delineating the structural domain over which an sar conclusion is valid
on the use of neural network ensembles in qsar and qspr despite their growing popularity among neural network practitioners ensemble methods have not been widely adopted in structure activity and structure property correlation neural networks are inherently unstable in that small changes in the training set and or training parameters can lead to large changes in their generalization performance recent research has shown that by capitalizing on the diversity of the individual models ensemble techniques can minimize uncertainty and produce more stable and accurate predictors in this work we present a critical assessment of the most common ensemble technique known as bootstrap aggregation or bagging as applied to qsar and qspr although aggregation does offer definitive advantages we demonstrate that bagging may not be the best possible choice and that simpler techniques such as retraining with the full sample can often produce superior results these findings are rationalized using krogh and vedelsby s 1995 decomposition of the generalization error into a term that measures the average generalization performance of the individual networks and a term that measures the diversity among them for networks that are designed to resist over fitting the benefits of aggregation are clear but not overwhelming
median partitioning a novel method for the selection of representative subsets from large compound pools a method termed median partitioning mp has been developed to select diverse sets of molecules from large compound pools unlike many other methods for subset selection the mp approach does not depend on pairwise comparison of molecules and can therefore be applied to very large compound collections the only time limiting step is the calculation of molecular descriptors for database compounds mp employs arrays of property descriptors with little correlation to divide large compound pools into partitions from which representative molecules can be selected in each of n subsequent steps a population of molecules is divided into subpopulations above and below the median value of a property descriptor until a desired number of 2 sup n partitions are obtained for descriptor evaluation and selection an entropy formulation was embedded in a genetic algorithm mp has been applied to generate a subset of the available chemicals directory and the results have been compared with cell based partitioning
chemical information based scaling of molecular descriptors a universal chemical scale for library design and analysis scaling is a difficult issue for any analysis of chemical properties or molecular topology when disparate descriptors are involved to compare properties across different data sets a common scale must be defined using several publicly available databases acd cmc mddr and nci as a basis we propose to define chemically meaningful scales for a number of molecular properties and topology descriptors these chemically derived scaling functions have several advantages first it is possible to define chemically relevant scales greatly simplifying similarity and diversity analyses across data sets second this approach provides a convenient method for setting descriptor boundaries that define chemically reasonable topology spaces for example descriptors can be scaled so that compounds with little potential for biological activity bioavailability or other drug like characteristics are easily identified as outliers we have compiled scaling values for 314 molecular descriptors in addition the 10th and 90th percentile values for each descriptor have been calculated for use in outlier filtering

information architecture notes toward a new curriculum there are signs that information architecture is coalescing into a field of professional practice however if it is to become a profession it must develop a means of educating new information architects lessons from other fields suggest that professional education typically evolves along a predictable path from apprenticeships to trade schools to college and university level education information architecture education may develop more quickly to meet the growing demands of the information society several pedagogical approaches employed in other fields may be adopted for information architecture education as long as the resulting curricula provide an interdisciplinary approach and balance instruction in technical and design skills with consideration of theoretical concepts key content areas are information organization graphic design computer science user and usability studies and communication certain logistics must be worked out including where information architecture studies should be housed and what kinds of degrees should be offered and at what levels the successful information architecture curriculum will be flexible and adaptable in order to meet the changing needs of students and the marketplace
information architecture in jasist just where did we come from the emergence of information architecture within the information systems world has been simultaneously drawn out yet rapid those with an eye on history are quick to point to wurman s 1976 use of the term architecture of information but it has only been in the last 2 years that ia has become the source of sufficient interest for people to label themselves professionally as information architects the impetus for this recent emergence of ia can be traced to a historical summit supported by asis t in may 2000 at boston it was here that several hundred of us gathered to thrash out the questions of just what ia was and what this new field might become at the time of the summit invited to present a short talk on my return journey from the annual acm sigchi conference i entered the summit expecting little and convinced that ia was nothing new i left 2 days later refreshed not just by the enthusiasm of the attendees for this term but by ia s potential to unify the disparate perspectives and orientations of professionals from a range of disciplines it was at this summit that the idea for the special issue took root i proposed the idea to don kraft hoping he would find someone else to run with it as luck would have it i ended up taking charge of it myself with initial support from david blair from the suggestion to the finished product has been the best part of 2 years and in that time more than 50 volunteers reviewed over 20 submissions
the impact of the internet on public library use an analysis of the current consumer market for library and internet services the potential impact of the internet on the public s demand for the services and resources of public libraries is an issue of critical importance the research reported in this article provides baseline data concerning the evolving relationship between the public s use of the library and its use of the internet the authors developed a consumer model of the american adult market for information services and resources segmented by use or nonuse of the public library and by access or lack of access to and use or nonuse of the internet a national random digit dialing telephone survey collected data to estimate the size of each of six market segments and to describe their usage choices between the public library and the internet the analyses presented in this article provide estimates of the size and demographics of each of the market segments describe why people are currently using the public library and the internet identify the decision criteria people use in their choices of which provider to use identify areas in which libraries and the internet appear to be competing and areas in which they appear to be complementary and identify reasons why people choose not to use the public library and or the internet the data suggest that some differentiation between the library and the internet is taking place which may very well have an impact on consumer choices between the two longitudinal research is necessary to fully reveal trends in these usage choices which have implications for all types of libraries in planning and policy development
duality revisited construction of fractional frequency distributions based on two dual lotka laws fractional frequency distributions of for example authors with a certain fractional number of papers are very irregular and therefore not easy to model or to explain the article gives a first attempt to this by as suming two simple lotka laws with exponent 2 one for the number of authors with n papers total count here and one for the number of papers with n authors n in n based on an earlier made convolution model of egghe interpreted and reworked now for discrete scores we are able to produce theoretical fractional frequency distributions with only one parameter which are in very close agreement with the practical ones as found in a large dataset produced earlier by rao 1995 the article also shows that irregular fractional frequency distributions are a consequence of lotka s law and are not examples of breakdowns of this famous historical law
relevance of web documents ghosts consensus method the dominant method currently used to improve the quality of internet search systems is often called digital democracy such an approach implies the utilization of the majority opinion of internet users to determine the most relevant documents for example citation index usage for sorting of search results google com or an enrichment of a query with terms that are asked frequently in relation with the query s theme digital democracy is an effective instrument in many cases but it has an unavoidable shortcoming which is a matter of principle the average intellectual and cultural level of internet users is very low everyone knows what kind of information is dominant in internet query statistics therefore when one searches the internet by means of digital democracy systems one gets answers that reflect an underlying assumption that the user s mind potential is very low and that his cultural interests are not demanding thus it is more correct to use the term digital ochlocracy to refer to internet search systems with digital democracy based on the well known mathematical mechanism of linear programming we propose a method to solve the indicated problem

designing a screening experiment for highly reliable products within a reasonable life testing time how to improve the reliability of highly reliable products is one of the great challenges by using a resolution iii experiment together with degradation test tseng et al 1995 presented a case study of improving the reliability of fluorescent lamps however in conducting such an experiment they did not address the problem of how to choose the optimal settings of variables such as sample size inspection frequency and termination time for each run which are influential to the correct identification of significant factors and the experimental cost assuming that the product s degradation paths satisfy wiener processes this paper proposes a systematic approach to the aforementioned problem first an identification rule is proposed next under the constraints of a minimum probability of correct decision and a maximum probability of incorrect decision of the proposed identification rule the optimum test plan can be obtained by minimizing the total experimental cost an example is provided to illustrate the proposed method
analysis and efficient implementation of a linguistic fuzzy c means the paper is concerned with a linguistic fuzzy c means fcm algorithm with vectors of fuzzy numbers as inputs this algorithm is based on the extension principle and the decomposition theorem it turns out that using the extension principle to extend the capability of the standard membership update equation to deal with a linguistic vector has a huge computational complexity in order to cope with this problem an efficient method based on fuzzy arithmetic and optimization has been developed and analyzed we also carefully examine and prove that the algorithm behaves in a way similar to the fcm in the degenerate linguistic case synthetic data sets and the iris data set have been used to illustrate the behavior of this linguistic version of the fcm
warranty reserves for nonstationary sales processes estimation of warranty costs in the event of product failure within the warranty period is of importance to the manufacturer costs associated with replacement or repair of the product are usually drawn from a warranty reserve fund created by the manufacturer considering a stochastic sales process first and second moments and thereby the variance are derived for the manufacturer s total discounted warranty cost of a single sale for single component items under four different warranty policies from a manufacturer s point of view these servicing strategies represent a renewable free replacement nonrenewable free replacement renewable pro rata and a nonrenewable minimal repair warranty plans the results are extended to determine the mean and variance of total discounted warranty costs for the total sales over the life cycle of the product furthermore using a normal approximation warranty reserves necessary for a certain protection level so that reserves are not completely depleted are found results and their managerial implications are studied through an extensive example

using netcloak to develop server side web based experiments without writing cgi programs server side experiments use the web server rather than the participant s browser to handle tasks such as random assignment eliminating inconsistencies with java and other client side applications heretofore experimenters wishing to create server side experiments have had to write programs to create common gateway interface cgi scripts in programming languages such as perl and c netcloak uses simple html like commands to create cgis we used netcloak to implement an experiment on probability estimation measurements of time on task and participants ip addresses assisted quality control without prior training in less than 1 month we were able to use netcloak to design and create a web based experiment and to help graduate students create three web based experiments of their own
open courseware and shared knowledge in higher education most college and university campuses in the united states and much of the developed world today maintain one two or several learning management systems lmss which are courseware products that provide students and faculty with web based tools to manage course related applications since the mid 1990s two predominant models of web courseware management systems have emerged commercial and noncommercial some of the commercial products available today were created in academia as noncommercial but have since become commercially encumbered other products remain noncommercial but are struggling to survive in a world of fierce commercial competition this article argues for an ethics of pedagogy in higher education that would be based on the guiding assumptions of the non proprietary peer to peer open source software movement
web based experiments controlled by javascript an example from probability learning javascript programs can be used to control web experiments this technique is illustrated by an experiment that tested the effects of advice on performance in the classic probability learning paradigm previous research reported that people tested via the web or in the lab tended to match the probabilities of their responses to the probabilities that those responses would be reinforced the optimal strategy however is to consistently choose the more frequent event probability matching produces suboptimal performance we investigated manipulations we reasoned should improve performance a horse race scenario in which participants predicted the winner in each of a series of races between two horses was compared with an abstract scenario used previously ten groups of learners received different amounts of advice including all combinations of 1 explicit instructions concerning the optimal strategy 2 explicit instructions concerning a monetary sum to maximize and 3 accurate information concerning the probabilities of events the results showed minimal effects of horse race versus abstract scenario both advice concerning the optimal strategy and probability information contributed significantly to performance in the task this paper includes a brief tutorial on javascript explaining with simple examples how to assemble a browser based experiment
using latent semantic analysis to assess reader strategies we tested a computer based procedure for assessing reader strategies that was based on verbal protocols that utilized latent semantic analysis lsa students were given self explanation reading training sert which teaches strategies that facilitate self explanation during reading such as elaboration based on world knowledge and bridging between text sentences during a computerized version of sert practice students read texts and typed self explanations into a computer after each sentence the use of sert strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self explanations this assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and lsa both human judgments and lsa were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with sert tended to paraphrase the text sentences whereas students who were compliant with sert tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context the similarity between human judgments and lsa indicates that lsa will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a web based version of sert
personality research on the internet a comparison of web based and traditional instruments in take home and in class settings students faculty and researchers have become increasingly comfortable with the internet and many of them are interested in using the web to collect data few published studies have investigated the differences between web based data and data collected with more traditional methods in order to investigate these potential differences two important factors were crossed in this study whether the data were collected on line or not and whether the data were collected in a group setting at a fixed time or individually at a time of the respondent s choosing the visions of morality scale shelton and mcadams 1990 was used and the participants were assigned to one of four conditions in class web survey in class paper and pencil survey take home web survey and take home paper and pencil survey no significant differences in scores were found for any condition however response rates were affected by the type of survey administered with the take home web based instrument having the lowest response rate therefore researchers need to be aware that different modes of administration may affect subject attrition and may therefore confound investigations of other independent variables
implications of document level literacy skills for web site design the proliferation of world wide web web sites and the low cost of publishing information on the web have placed a tremendous amount of information at the fingertips of millions of people although most of this information is at least intended to be accurate there is much that is rumor innuendo urban legend and outright falsehood this raises problems especially for students of all ages trying to do research or learn about some topic finding accurate credible information requires document level literacy skills such as integration sourcing corroboration and search this paper discusses these skills and offers a list of simple ways that designers of educational web sites can help their visitors utilize these skills

improving computer security for authentication of users influence of proactive password restrictions entering a user name password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems however it is a notoriously weak method in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack in an attempt to improve security proactive password checking may be used in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking in two experiments we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to log in the required length was a minimum of five characters in experiment i and eight characters in experiment 2 in both experiments one condition had only the length restriction and the other had additional restrictions the additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to log in for the five character passwords 75 were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed and this was reduced to 33 with the additional restrictions for the eight character passwords 17 were cracked with no other restrictions and 12 5 with restrictions the results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed

on batch constructing b sup trees algorithm and its performance evaluation efficient construction of indexes is very important in bulk loading a database or adding a new index to an existing database since both of them should handle an enormous volume of data in this paper we propose an algorithm for batch constructing the b sup tree the most widely used index structure in database systems the main characteristic of our algorithm is to simultaneously process all the key values to be placed on each b tree page when accessing the page this avoids the overhead due to accessing the same page multiple times which results from applying the b tree insertion algorithm repeatedly for performance evaluation we have analyzed our algorithm in terms of the number of disk accesses the results show that the number of disk accesses excluding those in the relocation process is identical to the number of pages belonging to the b sup tree considering that the relocation process is an unavoidable preprocessing step for batch constructing of b sup trees our algorithm requires just one disk access per b tree page and therefore turns out to be optimal we also present the performance tendency in relation with different parameter values via simulation finally we show the performance enhancement effect of our algorithm compared with the one using repeated insertions through experiments

from a biological to a computational model for the autonomous behavior of an animat endowing an autonomous system like a robot with intelligent behavior is difficult for several reasons first behavior is such a wide topic that a general framework paradigm of inspiration must be chosen in order to obtain a consistent model such a framework can be for example biological modeling or an artificial intelligence approach second a general framework is not sufficient to determine a fully specified program to be implemented in a robot many choices tuning and tests must be carried out before obtaining a robust system a biological model is presented based on the definition of cortex like automata representing elementary functions in the perceptive motor or associative domain these automata are connected in a network whose architecture functioning and learning rules are described in a cortical framework second the computational model derived from that biological model is specified the way units exchange and compute variables through links is explained with reference to corresponding biological elements it is then easier to report experiments allowing an autonomous system to learn regularities of a simple environment and to exploit them to satisfy some internal drives even if additional biological hints can be added this model allow us to better understand how a biological model can be implemented and how biological properties can emerge from a distributed set of units

speaker adaptive modeling by vocal tract normalization this paper presents methods for speaker adaptive modeling using vocal tract normalization vtn along with experimental tests on three databases we propose a new training method for vtn by using single density acoustic models per hmm state for selecting the scale factor of the frequency axis we avoid the problem that a mixture density tends to learn the scale factors of the training speakers and thus cannot be used for selecting the scale factor we show that using single gaussian densities for selecting the scale factor in training results in lower error rates than using mixture densities for the recognition phase we propose an improvement of the well known two pass strategy by using a non normalized acoustic model for the first recognition pass instead of a normalized model lower error rates are obtained in recognition tests this method is compared with a fast variant of vtn the two pass strategy is an efficient method but it is suboptimal because the scale factor and the word sequence are determined sequentially we found that for telephone digit string recognition this suboptimality reduces the vtn gain in recognition performance by 30 relative in summary on the german spontaneous speech task verbmobil the wsj task and the german telephone digit string corpus sietill the proposed methods for vtn reduce the error rates significantly

a strategy for a payoff switching differential game based on fuzzy reasoning in this paper a new concept of a payoff switching differential game is introduced in this new game any one player at any time may have several choices of payoffs for the future moreover the payoff switching process including the time of payoff switching and the outcome payoff of any one player is unknown to the other indeed the overall payoff which is a sequence of several payoffs is unknown until the game ends an algorithm for determining a reasoning strategy based on fuzzy reasoning is proposed in this algorithm the fuzzy theory is used to estimate the behavior of one player during a past time interval by deriving two fuzzy matrices gsm game similarity matrix and vgsm variation of gsm the behavior of the player can be quantified two weighting vectors are selected to weight the relative importance of the player s behavior at each past time instant finally a simple fuzzy inference rule is adopted to generate a linear reasoning strategy the advantage of this algorithm is that it provides a flexible way for differential game specialists to convert their knowledge into a reasonable strategy a practical example of guarding three territories is given to illustrate our main ideas

efficient tracking of the cross correlation coefficient in many audio processing algorithms involving manipulation of discrete time signals the performance can vary strongly over the repertoire that is used this may be the case when the signals from the various channels are allowed to be strongly positively or negatively correlated we propose and analyze a general formula for tracking the time dependent correlation between two signals some special cases of this formula lead to classical results known from the literature others are new this formula is recursive in nature and uses only the instantaneous values of the two signals in a low cost and low complexity manner in particular there is no need to take square roots or to carry out divisions furthermore this formula can be modified with respect to the occurrence of the two signals so as to further decrease the complexity and increase ease of implementation the latter modification comes at the expense that not the actual correlation is tracked but rather a somewhat deformed version of it to overcome this problem we propose for a number of instances of the tracking formula a simple warping operation on the deformed correlation now we obtain at least for sinusoidal signals the correct value of the correlation coefficient special attention is paid to the convergence behavior of the algorithm for stationary signals and the dynamic behavior if there is a transition to another stationary state the latter is considered to be important to study the tracking abilities to nonstationary signals we illustrate tracking algorithm by using it for stereo music fragments obtained from a number of digital audio recordings

approximate confidence intervals for one proportion and difference of two proportions constructing a confidence interval for a binomial proportion or the difference of two proportions is a routine exercise in daily data analysis the best known method is the wald interval based on the asymptotic normal approximation to the distribution of the observed sample proportion though it is known to have bad performance for small to medium sample sizes agresti et al 1998 2000 proposed an adding 4 method 4 pseudo observations are added with 2 successes and 2 failures and then the resulting pseudo sample proportion is used the method is simple and performs extremely well here we propose an approximate method based on a t approximation that takes account of the uncertainty in estimating the variance of the observed pseudo sample proportion it follows the same line of using a t test rather than z test in testing the mean of a normal distribution with an unknown variance for some circumstances our proposed method has a higher coverage probability than the adding 4 method

calibrated initials for an em applied to recursive models of categorical variables the estimates from an em when it is applied to a large causal model of 10 or more categorical variables are often subject to the initial values for the estimates this phenomenon becomes more serious as the model structure becomes more complicated involving more variables as a measure of compensation for this it has been recommended in literature that ems are implemented several times with different sets of initial values to obtain more appropriate estimates we propose an improved approach for initial values the main idea is that we use initials that are calibrated to data a simulation result strongly indicates that the calibrated initials give rise to the estimates that are far closer to the true values than the initials that are not calibrated
geometric source separation merging convolutive source separation with geometric beamforming convolutive blind source separation and adaptive beamforming have a similar goal extracting a source of interest or multiple sources while reducing undesired interferences a benefit of source separation is that it overcomes the conventional cross talk or leakage problem of adaptive beamforming beamforming on the other hand exploits geometric information which is often readily available but not utilized in blind algorithms we propose to join these benefits by combining cross power minimization of second order source separation with geometric linear constraints used in adaptive beamforming we find that the geometric constraints resolve some of the ambiguities inherent in the independence criterion such as frequency permutations and degrees of freedom provided by additional sensors we demonstrate the new method in performance comparisons for actual room recordings of two and three simultaneous acoustic sources

modelling dependencies in paired comparison data a log linear approach in many bradley terry models a more or less explicit assumption is that all decisions of the judges are independent an assumption which might be questionable at least for the decisions of a given judge in paired comparison studies a judge chooses among objects several times and in such cases judgements made by the same judge are likely to be dependent a log linear representation for the bradley terry model is developed which takes into account dependencies between judgements the modelling of the dependencies is embedded in the analysis of multiple binomial responses which has the advantage of interpretability in terms of conditional odds ratios furthermore the modelling is done in the framework of generalized linear models thus parameter estimation and the assessment of goodness of fit can be obtained in the standard way by using e g glim or another standard software
using k nearest neighbor classification in the leaves of a tree we construct a hybrid composite classifier by combining two classifiers in common use classification trees and k nearest neighbor k nn in our scheme we divide the feature space up by a classification tree and then classify test set items using the k nn rule just among those training items in the same leaf as the test item this reduces somewhat the computational load associated with k nn and it produces a classification rule that performs better than either trees or the usual k nn in a number of well known data sets
an approximation to the f distribution using the chi square distribution for the cumulative distribution function c d f of the f distribution f x k n with associated degrees of freedom k and n a shrinking factor approximation sfa g lambda kx k is proposed for large n and any fixed k where g x k is the chi square c d f with degrees of freedom k and lambda lambda kx n is the shrinking factor numerical analysis indicates that for n k or 3 approximation accuracy of the sfa is to the fourth decimal place for most small values of k this is a substantial improvement on the accuracy that is achievable using the normal ordinary chi square and scheffe tukey approximations in addition it is shown that the theoretical approximation error of the sfa f x k n g lambda kx k is o 1 n sup 2 uniformly over x
detection and estimation of abrupt changes in the variability of a process detection of change points in normal means is a well studied problem the parallel problem of detecting changes in variance has had less attention the form of the generalized likelihood ratio test statistic has long been known but its null distribution resisted exact analysis in this paper we formulate the change point problem for a sequence of chi square random variables we describe a procedure that is exact for the distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic for all even degrees of freedom and gives upper and lower bounds for odd and also for non integer degrees of freedom both the liberal and conservative bounds for chi sub 1 sup 2 degrees of freedom are shown through simulation to be reasonably tight the important problem of testing for change in the normal variance of individual observations corresponds to the chi sub 1 sup 2 case the non null case is also covered and confidence intervals for the true change point are derived the methodology is illustrated with an application to quality control in a deep level gold mine other applications include ambulatory monitoring of medical data and econometrics
flid dl congestion control for layered multicast we describe fair layered increase decrease with dynamic layering flid dl a new multirate congestion control algorithm for layered multicast sessions flid dl generalizes the receiver driven layered congestion control protocol rlc introduced by vicisano et al proc ieee infocom san francisco ca p 996 1003 mar 1998 ameliorating the problems associated with large internet group management protocol igmp leave latencies and abrupt rate increases like rlc flid dl is a scalable receiver driven congestion control mechanism in which receivers add layers at sender initiated synchronization points and leave layers when they experience congestion flid dl congestion control coexists with transmission control protocol tcp flows as well as other flid dl sessions and supports general rates on the different multicast layers we demonstrate via simulations that our congestion control scheme exhibits better fairness properties and provides better throughput than previous methods a key contribution that enables flid dl and may be useful elsewhere is dynamic layering dl which mitigates the negative impact of long igmp leave latencies and eliminates the need for probe intervals present in rlc we use dl to respond to congestion much faster than igmp leave operations which have proven to be a bottleneck in practice for prior work
a digital fountain approach to asynchronous reliable multicast the proliferation of applications that must reliably distribute large rich content to a vast number of autonomous receivers motivates the design of new multicast and broadcast protocols we describe an ideal fully scalable protocol for these applications that we call a digital fountain a digital fountain allows any number of heterogeneous receivers to acquire content with optimal efficiency at times of their choosing moreover no feedback channels are needed to ensure reliable delivery even in the face of high loss rates we develop a protocol that closely approximates a digital fountain using two new classes of erasure codes that for large block sizes are orders of magnitude faster than standard erasure codes we provide performance measurements that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and discuss the design implementation and performance of an experimental system
scalable secure group communication over ip multicast we introduce and analyze a scalable rekeying scheme for implementing secure group communications internet protocol multicast we show that our scheme incurs constant processing message and storage overhead for a rekey operation when a single member joins or leaves the group and logarithmic overhead for bulk simultaneous changes to the group membership these bounds hold even when group dynamics are not known a priori our rekeying algorithm requires a particular clustering of the members of the secure multicast group we describe a protocol to achieve such clustering and show that it is feasible to efficiently cluster members over realistic internet like topologies we evaluate the overhead of our own rekeying scheme and also of previously published schemes via simulation over an internet topology map containing over 280 000 routers through analysis and detailed simulations we show that this rekeying scheme performs better than previous schemes for a single change to group membership further for bulk group changes our algorithm outperforms all previously known schemes by several orders of magnitude in terms of actual bandwidth usage processing costs and storage requirements
distributed servers approach for large scale secure multicast in order to offer backward and forward secrecy for multicast applications i e a new member cannot decrypt the multicast data sent before its joining and a former member cannot decrypt the data sent after its leaving the data encryption key has to be changed whenever a user joins or leaves the system such a change has to be made known to all the current users the bandwidth used for such re key messaging can be high when the user pool is large we propose a distributed servers approach to minimize the overall system bandwidth and complexity by splitting the user pool into multiple groups each served by a logical server after presenting an analytic model for the system based on a hierarchical key tree we show that there is an optimal number of servers to achieve minimum system bandwidth as the underlying user traffic fluctuates we propose a simple dynamic scheme with low overhead where a physical server adaptively splits and merges its traffic into multiple groups each served by a logical server so as to minimize its total bandwidth our results show that a distributed servers approach is able to substantially reduce the total bandwidth required as compared with the traditional single server approach especially for those applications with a large user pool short holding time and relatively low bandwidth of a data stream as in the internet stock quote applications
speech enhancement using a mixture maximum model we present a spectral domain speech enhancement algorithm the new algorithm is based on a mixture model for the short time spectrum of the clean speech signal and on a maximum assumption in the production of the noisy speech spectrum in the past this model was used in the context of noise robust speech recognition in this paper we show that this model is also effective for improving the quality of speech signals corrupted by additive noise the computational requirements of the algorithm can be significantly reduced essentially without paying performance penalties by incorporating a dual codebook scheme with tied variances experiments using recorded speech signals and actual noise sources show that in spite of its low computational requirements the algorithm shows improved performance compared to alternative speech enhancement algorithms

time resolved contrast enhanced imaging with isotropic resolution and broad coverage using an undersampled 3d projection trajectory time resolved contrast enhanced 3d mr angiography mra methods have gained in popularity but are still limited by the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution a method is presented that greatly reduces this tradeoff by employing undersampled 3d projection reconstruction trajectories the variable density k space sampling intrinsic to this sequence is combined with temporal k space interpolation to provide time frames as short as 4 s this time resolution reduces the need for exact contrast timing while also providing dynamic information spatial resolution is determined primarily by the projection readout resolution and is thus isotropic across the fov which is also isotropic although undersampling the outer regions of k space introduces aliased energy into the image which may compromise resolution this is not a limiting factor in high contrast applications such as mra results from phantom and volunteer studies are presented demonstrating isotropic resolution broad coverage with an isotropic field of view fov minimal projection reconstruction artifacts and temporal information in one application a single breath hold exam covering the entire pulmonary vasculature generates high resolution isotropic imaging volumes depicting the bolus passage
three dimensional spiral mr imaging application to renal multiphase contrast enhanced angiography a fast mr pulse sequence with spiral in plane readout and conventional 3d partition encoding was developed for multiphase contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography ce mra of the renal vasculature compared to a standard multiphase 3d ce mra with flash readout an isotropic in plane spatial resolution of 1 4 1 4 mm sup 2 over 2 0 1 4 mm sup 2 could be achieved with a temporal resolution of 6 sec the theoretical gain of spatial resolution by using the spiral pulse sequence and the performance in the presence of turbulent flow was evaluated in phantom measurements multiphase 3d ce mra of the renal arteries was performed in five healthy volunteers using both techniques a deblurring technique was used to correct the spiral raw data thereby the off resonance frequencies were determined by minimizing the imaginary part of the data in image space the chosen correction algorithm was able to reduce image blurring substantially in all mra phases the image quality of the spiral ce mra pulse sequence was comparable to that of the flash ce mra with increased spatial resolution and a 25 reduced contrast to noise ratio additionally artifacts specific to spiral mri could be observed which had no impact on the assessment of the renal arteries
oxygen enhanced mri of the brain blood oxygenation level dependent bold contrast mri is a potential method for a physiological characterization of tissue beyond mere morphological representation the purpose of this study was to develop evaluation techniques for such examinations using a hyperoxia challenge administration of pure oxygen was applied to test these techniques as pure oxygen can be expected to induce relatively small signal intensity si changes compared to co sub 2 containing gases and thus requires very sensitive evaluation methods fourteen volunteers were investigated by alternating between breathing 100 o sub 2 and normal air using two different paradigms of administration changes ranged from 30 in large veins to 1 71 or 0 14 in basal ganglia and 0 82 or 0 08 in white matter to account for a slow physiological response function a reference for correlation analysis was derived from the venous reaction an objective method is presented that allows the adaptation of the significance threshold to the complexity of the paradigm used reference signal characteristics in representative brain tissue regions were established as the presented evaluation scheme proved its applicability to small si changes induced by pure oxygen it can readily be used for similar experiments with other gases
vibration control of structure by using tuned mass damper development of system which suppress displacement of auxiliary mass in vibration control of a structure by using an active tuned mass damper atmd stroke of the auxiliary mass is so limited that it is difficult to control the vibration in the case of large disturbance input in this paper two methods are proposed for the problem one of the methods is a switching control system by two types of controllers one of the controllers is a normal controller under small relative displacement of the auxiliary mass and the other is not effective only for first mode of vibration under large relative displacement of the auxiliary mass new variable gain control system is constructed by switching these two controllers the other method is the brake system in active vibration control it is necessary to use actuator for active control by using the actuator the proposed system puts on the brake to suppress displacement increase of the auxiliary mass under large disturbance input finally the systems are designed and the effectiveness of the systems is confirmed by the simulation

study of ambiguities inherent to the spectral analysis of voigt profiles a modified simplex approach in pulsed spectrometries temporal transients are often analyzed directly in the temporal domain assuming they consist only of purely exponentially decaying sinusoids when experimental spectra actually consist of gaussian or voigt profiles gauss lorentz profiles we show that the direct methods may erroneously interpret such lines as the sum of two or more lorentzian profiles using a nelder and mead simplex method modified by introducing new means to avoid degeneracies and quenchings in secondary minima we demonstrate that a large number of different solutions can be obtained with equivalent accuracy over the limited acquisition time interval with final peak parameters devoid of physical or chemical meaning

molecular descriptor selection combining genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic application to database mining procedures a new algorithm devoted to molecular descriptor selection in the context of data mining problems has been developed this algorithm is based on the concepts of genetic algorithms ga for descriptor hyperspace exploration and combined with a stepwise approach to get local convergence its selection power was evaluated by a fitness function derived from a fuzzy clustering method different training and test sets were randomly generated at each ga generation the fitness score was derived by combining the scores of the training and test sets the ability of the proposed algorithm to select relevant subsets of descriptors was tested on two data sets the first one an academic example corresponded to the artificial problem of bullseye the second was a real data set including 114 olfactory compounds divided into three odor categories in both cases the proposed method allowed to improve the separation between the different data set classes
application layer multicasting with delaunay triangulation overlays application layer multicast supports group applications without the need for a network layer multicast protocol here applications arrange themselves in a logical overlay network and transfer data within the overlay we present an application layer multicast solution that uses a delaunay triangulation as an overlay network topology an advantage of using a delaunay triangulation is that it allows each application to locally derive next hop routing information without requiring a routing protocol in the overlay a disadvantage of using a delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal we present a protocol called delaunay triangulation dt protocol which constructs delaunay triangulation overlay networks we present measurement experiments of the dt protocol for overlay networks with up to 10 000 members that are running on a local pc cluster with 100 linux pcs the results show that the protocol stabilizes quickly e g an overlay network with 10 000 nodes can be built in just over 30 s the traffic measurements indicate that the average overhead of a node is only a few kilobits per second if the overlay network is in a steady state results of throughput experiments of multicast transmissions using tcp unicast connections between neighbors in the overlay network show an achievable throughput of approximately 15 mb s in an overlay with 100 nodes and 2 mb s in an overlay with 1000 nodes
a case for end system multicast the conventional wisdom has been that internet protocol ip is the natural protocol layer for implementing multicast related functionality however more than a decade after its initial proposal ip multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability network management deployment and support for higher layer functionality such as error flow and congestion control we explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication this shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with ip multicast however the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model in particular end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end to end delays than ip multicast we study these performance concerns in the context of the narada protocol in narada end systems self organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol further end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance we present details of narada and evaluate it using both simulation and internet experiments our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives we believe the potential benefits of transferring multicast functionality from end systems to routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred
indexing neglected and poorly understood the growth of the internet has highlighted the use of machine indexing the difficulties in using the internet as a searching device can be frustrating the use of the term python is given as an example machine indexing is noted as rotten and human indexing as capricious the problem seems to be a lack of a theoretical foundation for the art of indexing what librarians have learned over the last hundred years has yet to yield a consistent approach to what really works best in preparing index terms and in the ability of our customers to search the various indexes an attempt is made to consider the elements of indexing their pros and cons the argument is made that machine indexing is far too prolific in its production of index terms neither librarians nor computer programmers have made much progress to improve internet indexing human indexing has had the same problems for over fifty years

expert advice how can my organisation take advantage of reverse auctions without jeopardising existing supplier relationships in a recent survey amr research found that companies that use reverse auctions to negotiate prices with suppliers typically achieve savings of between 10 and 15 on direct goods and between 20 and 25 on indirect goods and can slash sourcing cycle times from months to weeks suppliers however are less enthusiastic they believe that these savings are achieved only by stripping the human element out of negotiations and evaluating bids on price alone which drives down their profit margins as a result reverse auctions carry the risk of jeopardising long term and trusted relationships suppliers that have not been involved in a reverse auction before typically fear the bidding event itself arguably the most theatrical and therefore most hyped up part of the process although it may only last one hour weeks of preparation go into setting up a successful bidding event

a partial converse to hadamard s theorem on homeomorphisms a theorem by hadamard gives a two part condition under which a map from one banach space to another is a homeomorphism the theorem while often very useful is incomplete in the sense that it does not explicitly specify the family of maps for which the condition is met here under a typically weak additional assumption on the map we show that hadamard s condition is met if and only if the map is a homeomorphism with a lipschitz continuous inverse an application is given concerning the relation between the stability of a nonlinear system and the stability of related linear systems

design of high performance wavelets for image coding using a perceptual time domain criterion this paper presents a new biorthogonal linear phase wavelet design for image compression instead of calculating the prototype filters as spectral factors of a half band filter the design is based on the direct optimization of the low pass analysis filter using an objective function directly related to a perceptual criterion for image compression this function is defined as the product of the theoretical coding gain and an index called the peak to peak ratio which was shown to have high correlation with perceptual quality a distinctive feature of the proposed technique is a procedure by which given a good starting filter good filters of longer lengths are generated the results are excellent showing a clear improvement in perceptual image quality also we devised a criterion for constraining the coefficients of the filters in order to design wavelets with minimum ringing
design and implementation of a new sliding mode observer for speed sensorless control of induction machine in this letter a new sliding mode sensorless control algorithm is proposed for the field oriented induction machine drive in the proposed algorithm the terms containing flux speed and rotor time constant which are common in both current and flux equations in the current model of the induction machine are estimated by a sliding function the flux and speed estimation accuracy is guaranteed when the error between the actual current and observed current converges to zero hence the fourth order system is reduced to two second order systems and the speed estimation becomes very simple and robust to the parameter uncertainties the new approach is verified by simulation and experimental results
schedulability analysis of real time traffic in worldfip networks an integrated approach the worldfip protocol is one of the profiles that constitute the european fieldbus standard en 50170 it is particularly well suited to be used in distributed computer controlled systems where a set of process variables must be shared among network devices to cope with the real time requirements of such systems the protocol provides communication services based on the exchange of periodic and aperiodic identified variables the periodic exchanges have the highest priority and are executed at run time according to a cyclic schedule therefore the respective schedulability can be determined at pre run time when building the schedule table concerning the aperiodic exchanges the situation is different since their priority is lower and they are bandied according to a first come first served policy in this paper a response time based schedulability analysis for the real time traffic is presented such analysis considers both types of traffic in an integrated way according to their priorities furthermore a fixed priorities based policy is also used to schedule the periodic traffic the proposed analysis represents an improvement relative to previous work and it can be evaluated online as part of a traffic online admission control this feature is of particular importance when a planning scheduler is used instead of the typical offline static scheduler to allow online changes to the set of periodic process variables

a unifying co operative web caching architecture network caching of objects has become a standard way of reducing network traffic and latency in the web however web caches exhibit poor performance with a hit rate of about 30 a solution to improve this hit rate is to have a group of proxies form co operation where objects can be cached for later retrieval a cooperative cache system includes protocols for hierarchical and transversal caching the drawback of such a system lies in the resulting network load due to the number of messages that need to be exchanged to locate an object this paper proposes a new co operative web caching architecture which unifies previous methods of web caching performance results shows that the architecture achieve up to 70 co operative hit rate and accesses the cached object in at most two hops moreover the architecture is scalable with low traffic and database overhead

end user perspectives on the uptake of computer supported cooperative working researchers in information systems have produced a rich collection of meta analyses and models to further understanding of factors influencing the uptake of information technologies in the domain of cscw however these models have largely been neglected and while there are many case studies no systematic account of uptake has been produced we use findings from information systems research to structure a meta analysis of uptake issues as reported in cscw case studies supplemented by a detailed re examination of one of our own case studies from this perspective this shows that while there are some factors which seem to be largely specific to cscw introductions many of the case study results are very similar to standard is findings we conclude by suggesting how the two communities of researchers might build on each other s work and finally propose activity theory as a means of integrating the two perspectives

numerical modeling of the flow in stenosed coronary artery the relationship between main hemodynamic parameters the severity of coronary arterial stenosis is usually measured by either simple geometrical parameters such as percent diameter stenosis or hemodynamically based parameters such as the fractional flow reserve ffr or coronary flow reserve cfr the present study aimed to establish a relationship between actual hemodynamic conditions and the parameters that define stenosis severity in the clinical setting we used a computational model of the blood flow in a vessel with a blunt stenosis and an autoregulated vascular bed to simulate a stenosed blood vessel a key point in creating realistic simulations is to properly model arterial autoregulation a constant flow regulation mechanism resulted in cfr and ffr values that were within the physiological range while a constant wall shear stress model yielded unrealistic values the simulation tools developed in the present study may be useful in the clinical assessment of single and multiple stenoses by means of minimally invasive methods
a portable auto attendant system with sophisticated dialog structure an attendant system connects the caller to the party he she wants to talk to traditional systems require the caller to know the full name of the party if the caller forgets the name the system fails to provide service for the caller in this paper we propose a portable auto attendant system aas with sophisticated dialog structure that gives a caller more flexibility while calling the caller may interact with the system to request a phone number by providing just a work area specialty surname or title etc if the party is absent the system may provide extra information such as where he went when he will be back and what he is doing the system is built modularly with components such as speech recognizer language model dialog manager and text to speech that can be replaced if necessary by simply changing the personnel record database the system can easily be ported to other companies the sophisticated dialog manager applies many strategies to allow natural interaction between user and system functions such as fuzzy request user repairing and extra information query which are not provided by other systems are integrated into our system experimental results and comparisons to other systems show that our approach provides a more user friendly and natural interaction for auto attendant system
automated cerebrum segmentation from three dimensional sagittal brain mr images we present a fully automated cerebrum segmentation algorithm for full three dimensional sagittal brain mr images first cerebrum segmentation from a midsagittal brain mr image is performed utilizing landmarks anatomical information and a connectivity based threshold segmentation algorithm as previously reported recognizing that the cerebrum in laterally adjacent slices tends to have similar size and shape we use the cerebrum segmentation result from the midsagittal brain mr image as a mask to guide cerebrum segmentation in adjacent lateral slices in an iterative fashion this masking operation yields a masked image preliminary cerebrum segmentation for the next lateral slice which may truncate brain region s truncated regions are restored by first finding end points of their boundaries by comparing the mask image and masked image boundaries and then applying a connectivity based algorithm the resulting final extracted cerebrum image for this slice is then used as a mask for the next lateral slice the algorithm yielded satisfactory fully automated cerebrum segmentations in three dimensional sagittal brain mr images and had performance superior to conventional edge detection algorithms for segmentation of cerebrum from 3d sagittal brain mr images

ultrafast compound imaging for 2 d motion vector estimation application to transient elastography this paper describes a new technique for two dimensional 2 d imaging of the motion vector at a very high frame rate with ultrasound its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography but beyond this application it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging to date only axial displacements induced in human tissues by low frequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography the proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve young s modulus image reconstruction the process is a combination of several ideas well known in ultrasonic imaging ultra fast imaging multisynthetic aperture beamforming 1 d speckle tracking and compound imaging classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128 the beamforming is achieved only in the receive mode on two independent subapertures comparison of successive frames by a classical 1 d speckle tracking algorithm allows estimation of displacements along two different directions linked to the subapertures beams the variance of the estimates is finally improved by tilting the emitting plane wave at each insonification thus allowing reception of successive decorrelated speckle patterns
four terminal quantum resistor network for electron wave computing interconnected ultrathin conducting wires or equivalently interconnected quasi one dimensional electron waveguides which form a quantum resistor network are presented here in four terminal configurations the transmission behaviors through such four terminal networks are evaluated and classified in addition we show that such networks can be used as the basic building blocks for a possible massive wave computing machine in the future in a network each interconnection a node point is an elastic scatterer that routes the electron wave routing and rerouting of electron waves in a network is described in the framework of quantum transport from landauer buttiker theory in the presence of multiple elastic scatterers transmissions through various types of four terminal generalized clean aharonov bohm rings are investigated at zero temperature useful logic functions are gathered based on the transmission probability to each terminal with the use of the buttiker symmetry rule in the generalized rings even and odd numbers of terminals can possess some distinctly different transmission characteristics as we have shown here and earlier just as an even or odd number of atoms in a ring is an important quantity for classifying the transmission behavior we show here that whether the number of terminals is an even or an odd number is just as important in understanding the physics of transmission through such a ring furthermore we show that there are three basic classes of four terminal rings and the scaling relation for each class is provided in particular the existence of equitransmission among all four terminals is shown here this particular physical phenomena cannot exist in any three terminal ring comparisons and discussions of transmission characteristics between three terminal and four terminal rings are also presented the node equation approach by considering the kirchhoff current conservation law at each node point is used for this analysis many useful logic functions for electron wave computing are shown here in particular we show that a full adder can be constructed very simply using the equitransmission property of the four terminal ring this is in sharp contrast with circuits based on transistor logic

permission grids practical error bounded simplification we introduce the permission grid a spatial occupancy grid which can be used to guide almost any standard polygonal surface simplification algorithm into generating an approximation with a guaranteed geometric error bound in particular all points on the approximation are guaranteed to be within some user specified distance from the original surface such bounds are notably absent from many current simplification methods and are becoming increasingly important for applications in scientific computing and adaptive level of detail control conceptually simple the permission grid defines a volume in which the approximation must lie and does not permit the underlying simplification algorithm to generate approximations outside the volume the permission grid makes three important practical improvements over current error bounded simplification methods first it works on arbitrary triangular models handling all manners of mesh degeneracies gracefully further the error tolerance may be easily expanded as simplification proceeds allowing the construction of an error bounded level of detail hierarchy with vertex correspondences among all levels of detail and finally the permission grid has a representation complexity independent of the size of the input model and a small running time overhead making it more practical and efficient than current methods with similar guarantees

pareto optimal formulations for cost versus colorimetric accuracy trade offs in printer color management color management for the printing of digital images is a challenging task due primarily to nonlinear ink mixing behavior and the presence of redundant solutions for print devices with more than three inks algorithms for the conversion of image data to printer specific format are typically designed to achieve a single predetermined rendering intent such as colorimetric accuracy we present two cielab to cmyk color conversion schemes based on a general pareto optimal formulation for printer color management the schemes operate using a 149 color characterization data set selected to efficiently capture the entire cmyk gamut the first scheme uses artificial neural networks as transfer functions between the cielab and cmyk spaces the second scheme is based on a reformulation of tetrahedral interpolation as an optimization problem characterization data are divided into tetrahedra for the interpolation based approach using the program qhull which removes the common restriction that characterization data be well organized both schemes offer user control over trade off problems such as cost versus reproduction accuracy allowing for user specified print objectives and the use of constraints such as maximum allowable ink and maximum allowable ae sub ab a formulation for minimization of ink is shown to be particularly favorable integrating both a clipping and gamut compression features into a single methodology
meshed atlases for real time procedural solid texturing we describe an implementation of procedural solid texturing that uses the texture atlas a one to one mapping from an object s surface into its texture space the method uses the graphics hardware to rasterize the solid texture coordinates as colors directly into the atlas a texturing procedure is applied per pixel to the texture map replacing each solid texture coordinate with its corresponding procedural solid texture result the procedural solid texture is then mapped back onto the object surface using standard texture mapping the implementation renders procedural solid textures in real time and the user can design them interactively the quality of this technique depends greatly on the layout of the texture atlas a broad survey of texture atlas schemes is used to develop a set of general purpose mesh atlases and tools for measuring their effectiveness at distributing as many available texture samples as evenly across the surface as possible the main contribution of this paper is a new multiresolution texture atlas it distributes all available texture samples in a nearly uniform distribution this multiresolution texture atlas also supports mip mapped minification antialiasing and linear magnification filtering

domesticating computers and the internet the people who use computers and the ways they use them have changed substantially over the past 25 years in the beginning highly educated people mostly men in technical professions used computers for work but over time a much broader range of people are using computers for personal and domestic purposes this trend is still continuing and over a shorter time scale has been replicated with the use of the internet the paper uses data from four national surveys to document how personal computers and the internet have become increasingly domesticated since 1995 and to explore the mechanisms for this shift now people log on more often from home than from places of employment and do so for pleasure and for personal purposes rather than for their jobs analyses comparing veteran internet users to novices in 1998 and 2000 and analyses comparing the change in use within a single sample between 1995 and 1996 support two complementary explanations for how these technologies have become domesticated women children and less well educated individuals are increasingly using computers and the internet and have a more personal set of motives than well educated men in addition the widespread diffusion of the pc and the internet and the response of the computing industry to the diversity in consumers has led to a rich set of personal and domestic services
applying genetic algorithms to solve the fuzzy optimal profit problem this study investigated the application of genetic algorithms in solving a fuzzy optimization problem that arises in business and economics in this problem a fuzzy price is determined using a linear or a quadratic fuzzy demand function as well as a linear cost function the objective is to find the optimal fuzzy profit which is derived from the fuzzy price and fuzzy cost traditional methods for solving this problem are 1 the extension principle and 2 using interval arithmetic and alpha cuts however we argue that traditional methods for solving this problem are too restrictive to produce an optimal solution and that an alternative approach is possibly needed we use genetic algorithms to obtain an approximate solution for this fuzzy optimal profit problem without using membership functions we not only give empirical examples to show the effectiveness of this approach but also give theoretical proofs to validate correctness of the algorithm we conclude that genetic algorithms can produce good approximate solutions when applied to solve fuzzy optimization problems
failures and successes notes on the development of electronic cash between 1997 and 2001 two mid sized communities in canada hosted north america s most comprehensive experiment to introduce electronic cash and in the process replace physical cash for casual low value payments the technology used was mondex and its implementation was supported by all the country s major banks it was launched with an extensive publicity campaign to promote mondex not only in the domestic but also in the global market for which the canadian implementation was to serve as a showcase however soon after the start of the first field test it became apparent that the new technology did not work smoothly on the contrary it created a host of controversies in areas as varied as computer security consumer privacy and monetary policy in the following years few of these controversies could be resolved and mondex could not be established as a widely used payment mechanism in 2001 the experiment was finally terminated using the concepts developed in recent science and technology studies sts the article analyzes these controversies as resulting from the difficulties of fitting electronic cash a new sociotechnical system into the complex setting of the existing payment system the story of mondex not only offers lessons on why technologies fail but also offers insight into how short term failures can contribute to long term transformations this suggests the need to rethink the dichotomy of success and failure

community technology and democratic rationalization the objective of the paper is to explore questions of human agency and democratic process in the technical sphere through the example of virtual community the formation of relatively stable long term group associations community in the broad sense of the term is the scene on which a large share of human development occurs as such it is a fundamental human value mobilizing diverse ideologies and sensitivities the promise of realizing this value in a new domain naturally stirs up much excitement among optimistic observers of the internet at the same time the eagerness to place hopes for community in a technical system flies in the face of an influential intellectual tradition of technology criticism this eagerness seems even more naive in the light of the recent commercialization of so much internet activity despite the widespread skepticism we believe the growth of virtual community is significant for an inquiry into the democratization of technology we show that conflicting answers to the central question of the present theoretical debate is community possible on computer networks epsilon neralize from particular features of systems and software prevalent at different stages in the development of computer networking we conclude that research should focus instead on how to design computer networks to better support community activities and values
the network society as seen from italy italy was behind the european average in internet development for many years but a new trend which has brought considerable change emerged at the end of 1998 and showed its effects in 2000 and the following years now italy is one of the top ten countries worldwide in internet hostcount and the fourth largest in europe the density of internet activity in italy in proportion to the population is still below the average in the european union but is growing faster than germany the uk and france and faster than the worldwide or european average from the point of view of media control there are several problems italy has democratic institutions and freedom of speech but there is an alarming concentration in the control of mainstream media especially broadcast there are no officially declared restrictions in the use of the internet but several legal and regulatory decisions reveal a desire to limit freedom of opinion and dialogue and or gain centralized control of the net

data assimilation of local model error forecasts in a deterministic model one of the most popular data assimilation techniques in use today are of the kalman filter type which provide an improved estimate of the state of a system up to the current time level based on actual measurements from a forecasting viewpoint this corresponds to an updating of the initial conditions the standard forecasting procedure is to then run the model uncorrected into the future driven by predicted boundary and forcing conditions the problem with this methodology is that the updated initial conditions quickly wash out thus after a certain forecast horizon the model predictions are no better than from an initially uncorrected model this study demonstrates that through the assimilation of error forecasts in the present case made using so called local models entire model domains can be corrected for extended forecast horizons i e long after updated initial conditions have become washed out thus demonstrating significant improvements over the conventional methodology some alternate uses of local models are also explored for the re distribution of error forecasts over the entire model domain which are then compared with more conventional kalman filter type schemes

adaptive wavelet methods ii beyond the elliptic case this paper is concerned with the design and analysis of adaptive wavelet methods for systems of operator equations its main accomplishment is to extend the range of applicability of the adaptive wavelet based method developed previously for symmetric positive definite problems to indefinite or unsymmetric systems of operator equations this is accomplished by first introducing techniques such as the least squares formulation developed previously that transform the original continuous problem into an equivalent infinite system of equations which is now well posed in the euclidean metric it is then shown how to utilize adaptive techniques to solve the resulting infinite system of equations it is shown that for a wide range of problems this new adaptive method performs with asymptotically optimal complexity i e it recovers an approximate solution with desired accuracy at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of terms in a corresponding wavelet best n term approximation an important advantage of this adaptive approach is that it automatically stabilizes the numerical procedure so that for instance compatibility constraints on the choice of trial spaces like the lbb condition no longer arise

on generalized gaussian quadratures for exponentials and their applications we introduce new families of gaussian type quadratures for weighted integrals of exponential functions and consider their applications to integration and interpolation of bandlimited functions we use a generalization of a representation theorem due to caratheodory to derive these quadratures for each positive measure the quadratures are parameterized by eigenvalues of the toeplitz matrix constructed from the trigonometric moments of the measure for a given accuracy epsilon selecting an eigenvalue close to epsilon yields an approximate quadrature with that accuracy to compute its weights and nodes we present a new fast algorithm these new quadratures can be used to approximate and integrate bandlimited functions such as prolate spheroidal wave functions and essentially bandlimited functions such as bessel functions we also develop for a given precision an interpolating basis for bandlimited functions on an interval
a framework for image deblurring using wavelet packet bases we show that the average over translations of an operator diagonal in a wavelet packet basis is a convolution we also show that an operator diagonal in a wavelet packet basis can be decomposed into several operators of the same kind each of them being better conditioned we investigate the possibility of using such a convolution to approximate a given convolution in practice an image blur then we use these approximations to deblur images first we show that this framework permits us to redefine existing deblurring methods then we show that it permits us to define a new variational method which combines the wavelet packet and the total variation approaches we argue and show by experiments that this permits us to avoid the drawbacks of both approaches which are respectively ringing and staircasing

becoming a computer scientist the focus of this report is pipeline shrinkage for women in computer science we describe the situation for women at all stages of training in computer science from the precollege level through graduate school because many of the problems discussed are related to the lack of role models for women who are in the process of becoming computer scientists we also concern ourselves with the status of women faculty members we not only describe the problems but also make specific recommendations for change and encourage further study of those problems whose solutions are not yet well understood
the incredible shrinking pipeline we look at the harsh facts concerning the percentage of degrees awarded in cs to women we study the trend of degrees awarded in cs since 1980 and compare the trend in cs to other science and engineering disciplines we consider the relationship between the percentage of degrees awarded to women by a cs department and the college the cs department is within we find that cs departments in engineering colleges graduate on average proportionately fewer women than cs departments in non engineering colleges we request that the community respond to the facts and speculations presented in this article
an acm w literature review on women in computing the pipeline shrinkage problem for women in computer science is a well known and documented phenomenon where the ratio of women to men involved in computing shrinks dramatically from early student years to working years during the last decade considerable research ensued to understand the reasons behind the existence of the shrinking pipeline and in some cases to take action to increase the numbers of women in computing through the work of a national science foundation funded project acm s committee on women in computing acm w has taken a first step towards pulling this research together a large number of articles was gathered and processed on the topic of women in computing and the shrinking pipeline the committee created a publicly available online database to organize the references of this body of work by topic author and reference information the database constantly being updated is accessible through acm w s website http www acm org women a final report is also available via the acm w web site which covers current statistics on women in computing summaries of the literature in the database and a set of recommendations the article is a brief synopsis of a subset of the literature review as of august 2001
women in computing history exciting inventions innovative technology human interaction and intriguing politics fill computing history however the recorded history is mainly composed of male achievements and involvements even though women have played substantial roles this situation is not unusual most science fields are notorious for excluding undervaluing or overlooking the accomplishments of their female scientists as lee points out it is up to the historians and others to remedy this imbalance steps have been taken towards this goal through publishing biographies on women in technology and through honoring the pioneers with various awards such as the ghc 97 pioneering awards the witi hall of fame and the awc lovelace award a few online sites contain biographies of women in technology however even with these resources many women who have contributed significantly to computer science are still to be discovered
gender software design and occupational equity after reviewing the work on gender bias in software design a model of gender role influenced achievement choice taken from eccles 1994 is presented the paper concludes that 1 though laudable reduction of gender bias in software design is not the most straightforward way to reduce gender inequity in the choice of computing as a career 2 the model itself makes more clear some of the ethical issues involved in attempting to achieve gender equity on computing and 3 efforts to reduce gender inequity in the choice of computing as a career need to be evaluated in the light of this model
female computer science doctorates what does the survey of earned doctorates reveal based on the national center for education statistics 2000 in the 1997 1998 academic year 26 7 of earned bachelors degrees 29 0 of earned masters degrees and 16 3 of earned doctorates degrees in computer science were awarded to women as these percentages suggest women are underrepresented at all academic levels in computer science camp 1997 the most severe shortage occurs at the top level the doctorate in computer science we know very little about the women who persist to the top level of academic achievement in computer science this paper examines a subset of data collected through the survey of earned doctorates sed the specific focus of this paper is to identify trends that have emerged from the sed with respect to females completing doctorates in computer science between the academic years 1990 1991 and 1999 2000 although computer science doctorates include doctorates in information science prior research camp 1997 suggests that the percentage of women completing doctorates in information science as compared to computer science is low the specific research questions are 1 how does the percentage of women who complete doctorates in computer science compare to those that complete doctorates in other fields 2 how does the length of time in school and the sources of funding differ for females as compared to males who complete doctorates in computer science 3 where do women go after completing doctorates in computer science and what positions do they acquire how do these experiences differ from their male peers
a gendered view of computer professionals preliminary results of a survey the under representation of women in the computing profession in many parts the western world has received our attention through numerous publications the noticeable low representation of women at computer science conferences and in the lecture halls over the past two decades the situation had become worse this paper seeks to add to the dialogue by presenting preliminary findings from a research project conducted in four countries the aim of this research was to gain an insight into the perceptions future computer professionals hold on the category of employment loosely defined under the term of a computer professional one goal was to get insight into whether or not there is a difference between female and mate students regarding their view of computer professionals other goals were to determine if there was any difference between female and male students in different parts of the world as well as who or what most influences the students to undertake their courses in computing

a scanline based algorithm for the 2d free form bin packing problem this paper describes a heuristic algorithm for the 2d free form bin packing 2d fbp problem given a set of 2d free form bins and a set of 2d free form items the 2d fbp problem is to lay out items inside one or more bins in such a way that the number of bins used is minimized and for each bin the yield is maximized the proposed algorithm handles the problem as a variant of the 1d problem i e items and bins are approximated as sets of scanlines and scanlines are packed the details of the algorithm are given and its application to a nesting problem in a shipbuilding company is reported the proposed algorithm consists of the basic and the group placement algorithms the basic placement algorithm is a variant of the first fit decreasing algorithm which is simply extended from the 1d case to the 2d case by a novel scanline approximation a numerical study with real instances shows that the basic placement algorithm has sufficient performance for most of the instances however the group placement algorithm is required when items must be aligned in columns the qualities of the resulting layouts are good enough for practical use and the processing times are good
valuing corporate debt the effect of cross holdings of stock and debt we have developed a simple approach to valuing risky corporate debt when corporations own securities issued by other corporations we assume that corporate debt can be valued as an option on corporate business asset value and derive payoff functions when there exist cross holdings of stock or debt between two firms next we show that payoff functions with multiple cross holdings can be solved by the contraction principle the payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company cross holdings first the modigliani miller theorem can obtain when there exist cross holdings between firms second by establishing cross shareholdings each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the other s firm so that both firms can decrease credit risks by cross shareholdings in the numerical examples we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by cross holdings of stock using monte carlo simulation moreover we show we can calculate the default spread easily when complicated cross holdings exist and find which shares are beneficial or disadvantageous

speaker identification from voice using neural networks the paper provides three different schemes for speaker identification of personnel from their voice using artificial neural networks the first scheme recognizes speakers by employing the classical backpropagation algorithm pre trained with known voice samples of the persons the second scheme provides a framework for classifying the known training samples of the voice features using a hierarchical architecture realized with a self organizing feature map neural net the first scheme is highly robust as it is capable of identifying the personnel from their noisy voice samples but because of its excessive training time it has limited applications for a large voice database the second scheme though not so robust as the former however can classify an unknown voice sample to its nearest class the time needed for classification by the first scheme is always unique irrespective of the voice sample it is proportional to the number of feedforward layers in the network the time requirement of the second classification scheme however is not free from the voice features and is proportional to the number of 2d arrays traversed by the algorithm on the hierarchical structure the third scheme is highly robust and mis classification is as low as 0 2 per cent the third scheme combines the composite benefits of a radial basis function neural net and backpropagation trained neural net

the curious ways of professional cultures and the two body opportunity when two professionals are a couple we sometimes refer to them as having a two body problem however when each partner of a couple exists in the same cultures they also have an opportunity for deeply shared understanding and empathy simply because each understands at a deep level the culture in which the other works i explore this notion a couple has what we call the two body problem when both are professionals who are qualified for a kind of position that is relatively rare and who are very selective about the positions that they accept for example there are relatively scant numbers of jobs as a computer science professor at any level an individual considering an academic job may only be interested in research universities or in teaching universities restricting the choice of open positions substantially the classic two body problem arises when one partner wants to accept a new position that requires geographical relocation then the other partner also needs to find a new position moreover it can be very difficult to find a suitable position when they are naturally scarce

attribute generation based on association rules a decision tree is considered to be appropriate 1 if the tree can classify the unseen data accurately and 2 if the size of the tree is small one of the approaches to induce such a good decision tree is to add new attributes and their values to enhance the expressiveness of the training data at the data pre processing stage there are many existing methods for attribute extraction and construction but constructing new attributes is still an art these methods are very time consuming and some of them need a priori knowledge of the data domain they are not suitable for data mining dealing with large volumes of data we propose a novel approach that the knowledge on attributes relevant to the class is extracted as association rules from the training data the new attributes and the values are generated from the association rules among the originally given attributes we elaborate on the method and investigate its feature the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through some experiments

schema evolution in data warehouses we address the issues related to the evolution and maintenance of data warehousing systems when underlying data sources change their schema capabilities these changes can invalidate views at the data warehousing system we present an approach for dynamically adapting views according to schema changes arising on source relations this type of maintenance concerns both the schema and the data of the data warehouse the main issue is to avoid the view recomputation from scratch especially when views are defined from multiple sources the data of the data warehouse is used primarily in organizational decision making and may be strategic therefore the schema of the data warehouse can evolve for modeling new requirements resulting from analysis or data mining processing our approach provides means to support schema evolution of the data warehouse independently of the data sources

a fundamental investigation into large strain recovery of one way shape memory alloy wires embedded in flexible polyurethanes shape memory alloys smas are being embedded in or externally attached to smart structures because of the large amount of actuation deformation and force that these materials are capable of producing when they are heated previous investigations have focused primarily on using single or opposing sma wires exhibiting the two way shape memory effect sme because of the simplicity with which the repeatable actuation behavior of the structure can be predicted this repeatable actuation behavior is achieved at the expense of reduced levels of recoverable deformation alternatively many potential smart structure applications will employ multiple sma wires exhibiting a permanent one way sme to simplify fabrication and increase the recoverable strains in the structure to employ the one way wires it is necessary to investigate how they affect the recovery of large strains when they are embedded in a structure in this investigation the large strain recovery of a one way sma wire embedded in a flexible polyurethane is characterized using the novel deformation measurement technique known as digital image correlation these results are compared with a simple actuation model and a three dimensional finite element analysis of the structure using the brinson model for describing the thermomechanical behavior of the sma results indicate that the level of actuation strain in the structure is substantially reduced by the inelastic behavior of the one way sma wires and there are significant differences between the deformations of the matrix material adjacent to the sma wires and in the region surrounding it the transformation behavior of the sma wires was also determined to be volume preserving which had a significant effect on the transverse strain fields

modular and visual specification of hybrid systems an introduction to hycharts visual description techniques are particularly important for the design of hybrid systems because specifications of such systems usually have to be discussed between engineers from a number of different disciplines modularity is vital for hybrid systems not only because it allows to handle large systems but also because it permits to think in terms of components which is familiar to engineers based on two different interpretations for hierarchic graphs and on a clear hybrid computation model we develop hycharts hycharts consist of two modular visual formalisms one for the specification of the architecture and one for the specification of the behavior of hybrid systems the operators on hierarchic graphs enable us to give a surprisingly simple denotational semantics for many concepts known from statechart like formalisms due to a very general composition operator hycharts can easily be composed with description techniques from other engineering disciplines such heterogeneous system specifications seem to be particularly appropriate for hybrid systems because of their interdisciplinary character

modeling group foraging individual suboptimality interference and a kind of matching a series of agent based models support the hypothesis that behaviors adapted to a group situation may be suboptimal or irrational when expressed by an isolated individual these models focus on two areas of current concern in behavioral ecology and experimental psychology the interference function which relates the intake rate of a focal forager to the density of conspecifics and the matching law which formalizes the observation that many animals match the frequency of their response to different stimuli in proportion to the reward obtained from each stimulus type each model employs genetic algorithms to evolve foraging behaviors for multiple agents in spatially explicit environments structured at the level of situated perception and action a second concern of the article is to extend the understanding of both matching and interference per se by modeling at this level

discreteness and relevance a reply to roman poznanski in reply to poznanski see ibid p 435 2002 on discreteness and relevance eliasmith claims that all of the concerns voiced by poznanski in his reply fail to offer a serious challenge to the idea that continuity is irrelevant to a good understanding of cognitive systems eliasmith hopes that it is evident that he does not claim that the process in neural systems is discrete but rather that a complete characterization of the process can be discrete these of course are significantly different claims
the importance of continuity a reply to chris eliasmith in his reply to eliasmith see ibid vol 11 p 417 26 2001 poznanski considers how the notion of continuity of dynamic representations serves as a beacon for an integrative neuroscience to emerge he considers how the importance of continuity has come under attack from eliasmith 2001 who claims i continuous nature of neurons is not relevant to the information they process and ii continuity is not important for understanding cognition because the various sources of noise introduce uncertainty into spike arrival times so encoding and decoding spike trains must be discrete at some level
